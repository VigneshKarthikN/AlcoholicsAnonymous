The operations were coordinated efforts based on intel of smuggling and trafficking operations.
The first two suspects – a 24-year-old male and a 33-year-old male were arrested during a raid on a house located in the Maafannu district of Male’ City on February 20. The police, during the raid, confiscated two plastic packets containing what is to believe to be a narcotic substance.
The Criminal Court remanded the 33-year-old to 10 days in custody and the 24-year-old to one day in custody at a detention facility determined by Ministry of Home Affairs.
The police conducted a raid on an additional house in the Maafannu district of Male’ City on February 20 and arrested seven suspects – including a 20-year-old female and a minor.

8,['Norton Norton'],2019-03-23 00:00:00,,"There’s a Maldivian legend that describes how God, after he made the world, was overcome with emotion at the beauty of his creation and that he shed a few tears as a result which fell into the Indian Ocean, giving origin to the Maldive Islands.
Indeed, as we flew over the atolls and islands of the Maldives on our approach into the capital city of Male, we could not help but marvel at the sublime beauty of this island nation. Myriad tiny islands, surrounded by azure blue water, lie strewn across this vast stretch of ocean as if a bag of jewels had broken apart and spilt its precious gems onto the water.
We landed into Male and the tranquillity of the aerial scene was instantly punctured by the frenetic activity of the international airport. Hustling through, we caught sight of the capital city just across a small stretch of water. High rise office buildings, construction cranes and mosques all contributed to the skyline. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of boats were making their way to and fro…speedboats, fishing vessels, commercial ships and liveaboard yachts intermingled in the bustling waterway. It felt hot, crowded and chaotic.
But this was just a passing moment, the price of admission to a nation of proud elegance and jaw-dropping beauty. In just a few short moments, we had been whisked away by a speedboat headed for the nearby island of Huraa, located in the Male Atoll. Huraa is 30 minutes and an entire universe away from the choking confines of Male.
We arrived shortly after to a working dock on the island and were transported by golf cart to the Pearl Sands Beach Resort, a lovely property situated on a spectacular stretch of impossibly beautiful sand. With 32-rooms, a nice open-air restaurant and an onsite spa, we were tempted to retreat the comfort of a beach chair and skip the diving.
But, we were here to dive, and the Albatross Top Dive Center on site was our first stop after checking in. Time to schedule our dives, prepare our gear and get our camera systems ready.
The next morning, we boarded the dive Dhoni at the dock and headed off to the first dive of the day at a site known as The Aquarium. This is a sloping reef that opens onto a wide, sandy channel at about 100 feet of water. The Aquarium gets its name from the extreme profusion of fish life that seems to aggregate here. Large schools of Snapper, Grunts and Bigeye Trevally meander in circles in several of the coral cutouts.
As we swam along the reef, slowly descending to the sandy bottom, we spotted a curious Spotted Moray Eel poking its head out from its lair between two rocks. We maneuvered in the slight current to try for the best camera angle and as soon as we snapped the final image, a Hawksbill Turtle caught our eye cruising about 25 feet shallower on the reef. Almost as if fake, this turtle actually had a heart-shaped marking on its shell…was she trying to send us a message?
The Maldives are known for the outrageously colorful fish life abounding on its reefs. If you are a macro photographer, you will delight in searching for nudibranchs, anemone shrimp, blennies, gobies or porcelain crabs in the nooks and crannies of the coral jungles. We spotted a Decorator Crab that had us hysterically laughing with its trio of small anemones attached to its borrowed shell.
Words & photos by Michael Salvarezza and Christopher P. Weaver
Perhaps most entertaining, and often most frustrating for photographers, are the Anemonefish. Arrestingly beautiful they wiggle nervously in and out of the photogenic tentacles of the host anemone, moving out of focus or view the instant you press the shutter release. Good anemonefish images come with a healthy dose of throwaway images…it’s yet another price of admission to the beauty of the Maldives!
Some of the best marine life can often be found in the passes, or cuts, in the circling coral reef of the islands. Here, large volumes of water rush through during the tidal cycles, attracting huge schools of fish and pelagics looking for a meal. At Kani Corner, a dive site located at the bend in the reef near a pass, we spotted schools of Red Tail Butterflyfish sweeping over the reef, along with large groups of snapper and barracuda. In the pass, we saw a pair of Eagle Rays swoop through along with Whitetip Reef and Grey Reef Sharks in the distance.
The action is non-stop and it always seems as if our time is too short when we head to the surface for our safety stop, regardless of how long the dive was!
Besides diving, the center can organize snorkeling tours and dolphin encounters.
There are numerous other dive sites to explore off Huraa, but we also wanted to spend some time touring the island itself. This is a special place. Only a half hour from Male, this is an island that is just beginning to open its doors to tourism. Using the golf cart to explore, we met some of the local residents and got a sense of what daily life is like in this tine corner of the world. We spotted children leaving school wearing backpacks with colorful princess images alongside their parents in traditional Muslim attire. The traditional call to prayer would often ring out from the local mosque, and everyone we met flashed us a wide smile and a friendly nod of the head.
The dive team and staff at the Albatross Dive Center were extremely professional and very helpful. Our stay on Huraa, and our dives here, were memorable in both their underwater drama and in the peaceful time above the water. Huraa seems like it exists in the way that much of the world wishes it could.
Indeed, at dinner one evening, we struck up a conversation with one of the waiters named Hassan. Born and raised on Huraa, Hassan began talking about his love for soccer, or football as he calls it. Interestingly, the topic changed to the state of the world. And here, on this remote island so far removed from the rest of the world, Hassan profoundly said that “What’s happening in the world today is separating us. Sports is there to bring people together. We all need to come together!”
Hurray for Hussan, and Hurray for Huraa.
Getting There
The only international airport is located on the main island of Male. It is serviced with direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Colombo (Sri Lanka) and a few other destinations.
Visitors to the resort islands will next board speedboats or seaplanes depending on the location and distance of the resort. Check with your resort for arrangements. Many of the upscale resorts have comfortable lounges at the main airport where visitors can relax while waiting for transfers. Tours of Male can be arranged if the transfer time is longer than a few hours in duration.
There are domestic flights available on Maldivian Airlines for atolls in the south and north.
A valid passport is required for entry. Visas are not required.
When to go
The Maldives has an equatorial tropical climate. December through April is the dry season. February through April is the hottest time of the year, with temperatures in the 80s and 90s Fahrenheit each day. May through November is the rainy season.
Currency
The local currency is the rufiya (Rf) but US Dollars and Euros are generally accepted at all resorts.
Electricity
Power voltage used in the Maldives is220 Volts to 240 Volts (50 Hz). Be sure to double-check your appliance’s compatibility before plugging them in. Converters / adaptors are usually available upon request at your hotel front desk.
Customs
The Republic of the Maldives is a strict Islamic nation. Alcohol, firearms, pornography, pork, narcotics and “idols of worship” are among the prohibited items.
Because of the concern over evangelists spreading their beliefs within the country, attention is paid to religious items. A small crucifix, worn as jewelry, is unlikely to be a problem but a suitcase with several Bibles will likely create concern!

There is growing evidence that such disorders has increased among the teenagers and young adult in recent years and reported cases are alarming and getting worst by the day. As a result there is tendency towards the increase in low self esteem, violence, drug abuse and even suicide.
Researches have found that living close to nature and active lifestyle helps to improve and
recover from mental health issues in great deal. Nature around us (Sun, sand and beach in our case) is a natural blessing from the environment to reduce mental stress.
As corporate Wellness is gaining higher popularity in the recent years their is a potential business opportunity for entrepreneurs. As traditional sailboats (rialu dhoani or riya dhoani) are strongest symbol of our culture and craftsmanship.
Riyalu dhoani is something we are proud of, an inspiration from traditional sailing can be converted into integrated business model which can be used to overcome one of the serious social issue in our country as well as it will help to increase awareness about our culture.
Introducing sailing club integrated with rehabilitation service targeted for teenagers and
young adults will not only boost their mental health but also their physical health and
overall well being will be increased. It can Also be considered as a Corporate Wellness initiative.
There is a huge potential for sailing club in the Maldives since limited availability, while water sports is a developing trend among youth. Therefore scope of “Rehabilitation sailing” can be further expanded targeting towards tourists.

11,['Norton Norton'],2019-04-21 00:00:00,,"A family from the Maldives is locked in a desperate legal fight to stop their two-year-old son being deported from Australia because of his disability, amid fears being forced to move could lead to an early and painful death.
Key points: Kayban Jamshaad was born in Australia with severe health problems, including a brain injury
Medical experts say the boy faces the threat of early death because the Maldives cannot manage his complex needs
The Department of Home Affairs found there was insufficient “compelling” or “compassionate” reason for a waiver
Kayban Jamshaad has severe haemophilia — a bleeding disorder which stops blood clotting — and an acquired brain injury, which occurred when he was born at Bunbury Hospital in Western Australia.
He requires weekly medication for his haemophilia and round-the-clock care to manage spastic quadriplegia, visual impairment, seizure disorder and developmental delays arising from his brain injury.
Medical specialists said the Maldives was not equipped to manage Kayban’s complex health needs, and forcing him to live there would most likely be fatal.
“It’s actually [the difference] between him staying alive and dying, as hard as it is to put into words,” said his mother, Shizleen Aishath.
Doctors sound grave warnings
In a letter provided to the Department of Home Affairs, his rehabilitation physician warned that without proper care, Kayban would likely suffer a severe shortening of his muscles and joints, curvature of the spine, “osteoporosis, with a high risk of pathological fractures, hip dislocation, malnutrition, respiratory failures and premature death”.
WA Health’s Haemophilia Service also advised the department that the Maldives does not have the resources or systems in place to provide adequate treatment.
Despite those warnings, the department ruled there was not enough documentary evidence, or “compelling” and “compassionate” circumstances, to grant Kayban a health waiver that would allow him to stay.
“The refusal to allow a child to stay even though he faces the certainty of a painful and premature death — if that’s not sufficiently compassionate and compelling then I don’t know what is,” said migration agent Jan Gothard, who is a health and disability specialist with Estrin Saul Lawyers, which is handling the case.
Kayban’s mother is currently working as a social worker in Bunbury and holds a temporary skilled shortage visa.
Her husband, daughter and other son were all granted support visas.
‘It comes down to an algorithm’
Under Australia’s immigration laws, applicants can be rejected if they have any condition which could result in significant healthcare costs or prejudice the access of Australian citizens and residents to health services.
The department estimated Kayban’s health costs would be $59,000 a year.
It said it was not satisfied his family could cover that cost, despite them doing so for almost three years without any access to any public health support, including Medicare.
“I’d like to think we are managing fine — all our bills are covered,” Mrs Aishath said.
Dr Gothard said the visa that Kayban applied for would disqualify him from receiving any public health benefits, so the estimated costs were irrelevant.
“These costs simply cannot accrue, and yet [applicants] are costed and they fail the health requirement as if they were going to be able to access these services,” she said.
“It’s not logical, it’s not rational, it’s just silly.”
Kayban’s case has been taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal — a legal process that could take months.
While the family awaits that outcome, disability advocates say it is yet another example of Australia’s discriminatory immigration laws.
“Frankly it’s obscene that we treat people with a disability this way,” said Dwayne Cranfield, the chief executive of the National Ethnic Disability Alliance.
“People are broken down to a cost-benefit essentially, it comes down to an algorithm — the humanity is taken out of the situation, you become an equation.”
Law exemption allows disability discrimination
Dr Gothard says dozens of families are affected every year, and the impact is even more widespread.
“I think it sends a very strong message to people with disability living in Australia … that basically people with disabilities are considered a burden on the Australian society, she said.
“They’re not deemed to contribute in any way at all and, given the choice, the Australian Government would much rather they weren’t here.”
The department said it would not comment on individual cases, but insisted its policy was not discriminatory.
“All applicants are treated in an equal and fair manner,” a spokesperson said.
But Dr Gothard said that was “bureaucratic doublespeak”, and pointed to the Migration Act’s exemption from the Disability Discrimination Act, to allow discrimination on the grounds of disability in migration decisions.
Mrs Aishath’s employer told the department she would be “exceedingly difficult to replace” if her family was forced back to the Maldives, and “it would be a great loss to our company and to the region.”
Many families face the same fate
The treatment of Kayban and his family is not unique.
A Seymour couple, who moved from Ireland to central Victoria in 2009, has been rejected for permanent residency because they had a son who was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy.
On Queensland’s Western Downs, a family of six is fighting deportation back to the Philippines because of their son’s autism.
And in Queanbeyan, a Bhutanese family fears their hearing-impaired son, who has learned Australian sign language, will experience a “world of isolation” as they face deportation because of his disability.
Another woman who knows first-hand the perils of Australia’s immigration system is Nicole Forbes-Hood, who endured a two-year struggle to secure a visa for her son Cameron.
Her family moved from New Zealand to Beerwah, on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast Hinterland, in 2009.
Within a few years, both parents and one daughter had citizenship or permanent residency, but Cameron was rejected multiple times because of his autism and intellectual disability.
“It felt really awful,” Ms Forbes-Hood said.
“Just because he’s got an intellectual disability and has special needs doesn’t mean he can’t contribute to the community and society as a whole.”
By July 2017, the family had spent more than $20,000 in legal fees and were resigned to moving back to New Zealand.
But a last-ditch appeal to the then-Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton, was successful, and Cameron was granted permanent residency.
Ms Forbes-Hood said it was a disgrace that other families were still enduring the same problems.
“I just think it’s so unfair that other families can be treated like that,” she said.
For Shizleen Aishath, the legal fight adds an extra layer of complexity to the day-to-day realities of raising a young family.
“We’ve been trying to survive the system for three years and, to be entirely honest, I don’t know how much longer I can do it,” she said.
“As a mother, all I know is that I would do anything to make sure that Kayban gets the care he needs to be able to stay alive and not be in pain.”

13,['Norton Norton'],2019-04-13 00:00:00,,"The incredible house reef at Anantara Kihavah Maldives Villas is home to a variety of marine species varying from planktonic organisms to sharks, crustaceans and corals. Here dolphins, turtles, eagle rays and reef sharks can be seen thriving in their natural habitat.
The resident marine biologist is instrumental in protecting the biodiversity of the house reef by developing reef restoration projects including Anantara’s Coral Adoption Programme, fragmentation cloning and a Kids Marine Biology Programme. The reef protects the pristine beach and guards the crystal-clear lagoon. It also supports an astounding array of tropical fish, crustaceans and bizarre-looking molluscs. Despite its apparent resilience, coral is a sensitive organism, vulnerable to extreme weather, sudden environmental changes and damage caused by fish.
Three coral propagation nurseries have been established to assist in the rehabilitation of the house reef which is often degraded as a result of parrotfish and other tropical fish colliding into the reef and inadvertently breaking off pieces of hard coral. Over twenty-five, different species of branch coral from the Acropora colony including table coral, elkhorn coral and staghorn coral have been propagated and transplanted. Staghorn corals are among the fastest growing corals on reefs and are exceptional reef-builders.
Guests can participate in reef creation and contribute to the resorts on-going conservation efforts by adopting a coral rope. Finger-sized coral fragments that have already broken off from the reef are collected by the resident marine biologist and together with the guest, these are transplanted onto a rope in the lagoon and then placed in one of the nurseries. Within 18-months the propagated corals are ready to be transplanted to a degraded part of the house reef. Each piece of coral that is replanted helps the reef to prosper and allows coral adoptees to play a vital role.
The main objective of coral restoration is to revive species of hard corals which provide the structure for the rest of the reef community which includes soft corals, sea urchins, crustaceans and fish. However, it is not enough to just transplant hard coral as a healthy reef lives in harmony with the species that live on and around it. Herbivorous fish such as parrotfish are important for helping coral to reproduce as they consume seaweed which competes for space with coral on the reef and the resident biologist has instigated a programme to eliminate cushion starfish as they prohibit new coral growth.
The Kids Marine Biology Programme introduces kids ranging from eight upwards to diving and snorkelling and teaches them in a fun and interesting way about the reef ecosystem and the diversity of the reef community. The programme fosters a love of the ocean and its many creatures and even kids as young as eight, bubble makers as they are endearingly called can learn to dive to 2-meters and 10-year-old kids and older can participate in the discover scuba-diving programme. Children get hands-on learning experience through a 3-series programme including puzzles, word search, activities, research and night snorkelling.
In addition to the Kids Marine Biology Programme, once a week at Thiththi Boli Kids Club, the marine biologist tells the tiny visitors (4 to 12 year’s old) reef stories and takes them to visit the underwater SEA restaurant to teach them how to identify fish in their natural habitat.

He also said that the number of patients in the waiting lists are very high and it’s not easy to get the medication they need from the country.
“Mental illness is not just depression. It’s not just someone having disabilities. Even those with mental illnesses will have a better time if they can get the appropriate treatment they deserve. I hope that the clinic that has been opened today will help ease the difficulties that those with mental illnesses face,” said the President.
Speaking more in the ceremony, Solih said that it’s possible for anyone to face mental illnesses. He said that the clinic opened today will be upgraded in the future and the government would give importance to train more specialist doctors and consultants.
“Just opening a clinic for mental healthcare is not going to cure the patients. They will need the love and care from their families and loved ones,” stated President Solih.
Services provided by the clinic include consultation in OPD, getting admitted in the clinic for further care, emergency care, diagnosis of mental illnesses, medication, psychological consultation, rehabilitation, occupational therapy and counselling.

The ambitious project comprises 3,105 panels and spans 5,380 square metres (58,000 square feet) – the roof surface of the staff village – and has been installed by Swimsol, specialists in tropical coastal-region solar systems.
It is estimated that the new solar set-up will produce between 900,000 and 1.1 million kWh of energy every year and save between 250,000 and 300,000 litres (55,000-66,000 gallons) of diesel, which corresponds to 650-800 tons of CO2.
Putting this data into perspective, the annual savings equate to powering all 103 of Landaa’s luxurious guest rooms, villas, and suites for 32 days or charging one of the resort’s eco-friendly electric golf cars more than 82,000 times.
In daily terms, it’s the daily equivalent of powering 15 Villas for 24 hours; applying reverse osmosis technology to 540 cubic metres (19,000 cubic feet) of water at the resort’s onsite desalination plant; or washing and drying 3,350 kilograms (7,400 pounds) of laundry.
Finally, looking at the diesel-saving ability, the annual figure equates to driving around the world 94 times – with the corresponding annual CO2 reduction eliminating the emissions of 544 flights between London to Male.
“Our Baa Atoll home became Maldives’ first UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve in 2011 on account of its unique harmony between man and nature, and we take our role in preserving that status very seriously,” said Armando Kraenzlin, Four Seasons Resorts Maldives Regional Vice President. “This project is an important rung on our conservation ladder and takes us a step closer to reaching our eventual goal of becoming carbon-neutral.”
Conservation at Landaa has been a serious topic since the resort opened in 2006. The plastic reduction has been a top priority with paper straws introduced in 2010 and reusable glass water bottles in 2012, saving 365,000 plastic bottles annually. The latest partnership with Parley recycles any leftover plastic into clothes, shoes and more.
In addition, Landaa runs one of Maldives’ leading centres of marine conservation and research, working in partnership with local and national environmental agencies and employing 10 full-time marine biologists to deliver pioneering activities every day including turtle rehabilitation, coral propagation, manta research, sustainable fish breeding, anemone mapping, dolphin ID and more.

18,['Norton Norton'],2019-03-15 00:00:00,,"Former president Mohamed Nasheed was forced on the defensive Wednesday after religious scholars denounced comments he made at a campaign event about developing the burgeoning mid-market tourism industry.
Lauding the success of guesthouse tourism on local islands introduced during his administration, Nasheed appeared to suggest a “bigger profit” could be made by authorising the sale of alcohol.
“I’m certain no one would have thought we were opening a multi-million, billion dollar industry when we decided to give permits for tourist business on inhabited islands back in 2009,” he said Tuesday night on the Thoddoo island in Alif Alif Atoll.
“But there are certain realities in this world. Perfume is what sells most in the world, and then chocolate, alcohol and cigarettes. We know when we do business with these things, there’s a huge profit and we get richer.”
He added: “Guesthouse tourism can be done much better in the Maldives. If we really think about it, it becomes an undeniable reality that we can take a [bigger] profit from this business.”
The sale of alcohol and pork is prohibited by law on inhabited islands as their consumption is strictly forbidden in Islam. But both are readily available on “uninhabited” resort islands.
Taxes from tourism goods and services account for nearly 30 per cent of government income.
In the face of accusations from religious scholars about pursuing a hidden anti-Islamic agenda, Nasheed insisted on Wednesday that he was not in favour of legalising the sale of alcohol.
“I don’t agree with selling alcohol on inhabited islands and I have not spoken in favour of it. The sad thing is those who spread this message and use religion as a weapon are the ones linked to the people who sell the most alcohol in the Maldives,” tweeted the former president, now a Maldivian Democratic Party candidate for the April 6 parliamentary elections.
Religion is a hot-button issue in local politics.
Nasheed was accused of pursuing a secularisation agenda both during his three-year administration and his failed re-election bid in 2013. Religion was also a prominent part of the 2018 campaign with former president Abdulla Yameen accusing the opposition coalition of planning to introduce anti-Islamic practices to the 100 percent Muslim Maldives.
The sheikhs and scholars who denounced Nasheed’s alleged call to legalise alcohol sale included senior members of the Adhaalath Party, one of the four parties in the MDP-led ruling coalition, as opposition candidates also seized upon the controversy.
The MDP is competing against coalition partners as well as the opposition after deciding not to divide seats among the four coalition parties.
“The money earned from selling something forbidden by Allah will be haram,” Dr Mohamed Iyaz tweeted.
“While Allah has revealed that the sin in alcohol is bigger than its benefits, Muslims looking at only the benefits will condemn you to damnation in both worlds,” echoed Sheikh Ilyas Hussain, sharing a verse from the Quran.
Both scholars are senior members of the Adhaalath Party.
“I urge beloved Maldivians to stay cautious of outright sinful talk and hidden plans with evil intentions. Even if you fill your pockets with money, you go to the grave empty handed. For Muslims there is the afterlife as well, we must not forget,” Sheikh Ali Zaid warned.
“Don’t try to destroy the Islamic nationalism and discipline that’s been here for 800 years by showing people the fantasy of money. I call on all Muslim people not to vote for these people in the upcoming elections,” Zaid said in a second tweet.
In January, Nasheed was accused by prominent scholars of encouraging premarital sex for saying unmarried women should be prescribed contraception or allowed to have a tubectomy to prevent birth out of wedlock.
He later apologised for “misunderstandings” caused by his remarks, which he said was about children born out of wedlock who become vulnerable to drug addiction.

19,['Norton Norton'],2018-07-26 00:00:00,,"The Maldives Customs Service Tuesday announced new measures to track imported pork and alcohol products in the country, local media reported.
Commissioner General of Customs, Mohamed Junaid, told reporters that all vessels carrying pork and alcohol shipments will be tracked and monitored using satellite.
The aim is to ensure that pork and alcohol shipments end up in their approved locations.
It is a crime for Maldivians to consume pork or alcohol and such products are banned from inhabited islands. However, under a special permit, tourist resorts can offer these items to their foreign guests.
“We will know the resort to which the vessel has to transfer the goods. So we will know [through satellite tracking] if the vessel heads off or tries to head off to some other location,” Junaid said.
The new measure will help “somewhat control” the illegal smuggling of alcohol products, he added.
Customs also announced an increase of 42 percent in drugs confiscated by the agency while being smuggled in to the country.
Chief Superintendent Ismail Hamdhoon said 23 kilos of drugs had been confiscated so far this year, including 9.8 kilos of cannabis types and 8.9 kilos of heroin confiscated in 54 investigations.
Hamdhoon also said the amount of “party drugs” being confiscated has increased.

Briefing the press about the operation, Inspector Rajni Shuaib said the Maldivian suspects have criminal records for assault and alcohol consumption whilst the two foreigners were undocumented workers.
The suspects were using the rented house that was raided for their illegal alcohol sales, the acting head of the drug enforcement department saidWednesday. Preliminary investigations have established that the alcohol was released from a bonded warehouse in Hulhumalé to a safari vessel, he added.
He appealed for cooperation from safari and speedboat operators and Malé homeowners to tackle the entrenched alcohol black market.
As alcohol consumption is prohibited by Islam, liquor import licenses are only issued to tourism businesses for sale to non-Maldivians.
Locals caught drinking alcohol are fined and sentenced to 40 lashes. A flogging sentence was most recently handed to a 27-year-old man who was found intoxicated by police officers in January last year.
A Maldivian consuming alcohol or pork is a class three misdemeanour in the 2014 penal code. A convict may receive a jail sentence ranging from six days to three months.
The law also gives a judge the authority to pass an additional sentence of 40 lashes, as consuming alcohol or pork is a hudud offence – a crime for which a punishment is prescribed under sharia law.
Although the Maldives legal system is a combination of sharia and common law, sharia sentences are uncommon. An amendment brought to the penal code in 2015 requires all appeal processes be exhausted before Islamic sharia punishments can be meted out.

The commissioner general of Customs, Ibrahim Shareef, told Mihaaru that they are currently following the temporary permit granted by the government on Monday to issue alcohol and pork to Villa resorts again.
The government has granted a week’s time for Villa resorts to import alcohol and pork after withholding the import license of Royal Island Resort on January 21. The government has been withholding the permits of Holiday Island Resort, Paradise Island Resort, Sun Island Resort and Fun Island Resort since March 2017.
The state had decided to withhold their permits last March after Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA) accused Villa Shipping and Trading Company, which operates four of Villa’s resorts, of failing to pay required taxes. The permit of Royal Island Resort was held this Sunday after its operator Island Trade and Travel Pvt Ltd was accused of illegally transferring alcohol and pork to the other resorts. In the meantime, MIRA has also announced that the Villa resorts had failed to pay taxes for the last 10 months, amounting to USD 5.1 million.
The tourism ministry stated that they issued Villa a temporary permit since the resorts currently have guests. The ministry noted that the tourism industry is the biggest and most profitable one for the economy, and they do not want to jeopardize it.
“Plot to bankrupt”
Villa officials and Qasim have been insisting that Villa had not done anything illegal. In a letter sent to the employees of Villa, Qasim accused the government of orchestrating a plot to bankrupt him. He stated that this government does not want him to continue the things he has been doing for the development of the Maldives and its people.
Qasim denied all accusations of illegal doings in the letter, stating that he has and will always abide by the rules. He went on to say that Villa has always paid whatever taxes that need to be paid. He accused the state of violating the agreements that had been previously made, adding that they have filed cases at court for justice.
“Right now, our biggest strength is the honesty and steadfastness of our employees,” said Qasim praising his staff. He said that the reason Villa has progressed so much is due to the employees, and that he will always do everything within his capacity to make things better for them as well as their families.
Qasim, who is hopeful for candidacy from the joint opposition in the presidential elections this year, said that he is not in politics for any personal agendas and that he only wants to serve the people of the Maldives with his experience.
The state and Villa Group continue to exchange fire, as investigations continue regarding the matter.

Hafiz Saeed and Ali Abdul Sattar, from Gaaf Dhaal Vaadhoo and Malé, were handed the flogging sentence Sunday by the Criminal Court.
The sentence said the two man had admitted to “regularly drinking alcohol” during a police investigation and repeated this admission in court.
As a result, they were sentenced to 27 days in prison and a flogging of 40 lashes.
The judge commuted the jail sentence to a fine of MVR5,400 (US$350), which has to be paid to the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority within a month. Failure to pay the fine within the period will result in the original sentence of 27 days in jail, the sentence said.
A Maldivian consuming alcohol or pork is a Class 3 misdemeanour, listed under Public Order and Safety Offences in the Maldives Penal Code. A convict may receive a jail sentence ranging from six days to three months.

24,['Norton Norton'],2018-01-24 00:00:00,,"Amidst the recent controversy, the Maldives government has decided to grant opposition Jumhoory Party leader Qasim Ibrahim’s resorts a temporary permit to import alcohol and pork products.
The licenses to import alcohol and pork products, which were issued to Qasim Ibrahim’s Villa Shipping and Trading Company and the resorts operated under the Villa umbrella, had been revoked last year March by the economic ministry. Since then, Royal Island Resort, which is operated under Qasim Ibrahim’s Island Travel and Trade Pvt Ltd, was the only one permitted to import alcohol and pork.
However, Maldives Customs Service in conjunction with the police had commenced raids on all the resorts last Thursday, claiming that alcoholic beverages and pork products, issued from Customs’ bonded warehouse to Royal Island Resort, had been distributed illegally to the other resorts as well. While Customs had seized some of the alcohol from Fun Island Resort’s storage, the economic ministry decided to withhold Royal Island Resort’s permit to import pork and alcohol as well.
The development had sparked much controversy, with members of the opposition calling the raids a targeted attack on Qasim Ibrahim’s resorts, while resort employees and the residents of Alif Dhaal atoll Maamigili island, the former constituency of Qasim, had held protests.
Amidst the outcry, the tourism ministry declared in a statement Monday that it has requested the economic ministry to issue a temporary permit of 14 days to the resorts operated under the subsidiaries of Qasim Ibrahim’s conglomerate Villa Group. The reason for the permit, according to the tourism ministry, is to provide the necessary services to the tourists and guests currently vacationing at the resorts.
Villa’s resorts had previously said that they were full booked with many of their guests on all-inclusive packages, which include provision of alcoholic beverages and pork products. Concerns have also been raised that such raids being conducted at the peak of the Maldives’ tourism season would negatively impact the tourism industry as a whole.
In its statement Monday, the tourism ministry acknowledged the vitality of the tourism sector for the nation’s economy and stressed the importance of providing satisfactory services to tourists.
“The government’s decision [to grant a temporary permit] was also based on discussions held with Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) and various other stakeholders,” added the ministry.
The statement further highlighted that several companies of Villa Group are being sued by Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA) over failure to settle lease payments and other fees for various islands and lagoons that were leased to the companies for tourism development. MIRA has also repeatedly ordered Villa’s resorts to settle long lists of unpaid Green Tax and Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST) owed to the state.
Noting that operating resorts without settling taxes and fees is a violation of contracts and laws, the tourism ministry stated that the government withholds certain services to companies that fail to settle payments, which by extension could affect the services provided to tourists. Thus, the tourism ministry called on operators of the tourism sector to adhere to laws and regulations, which it declared is the only permanent solution to such issues.
The ministry further assured that the government would always work to ensure trust with foreign investors and maintain the Maldives as one of the best destinations in the world.

25,['Norton Norton'],2018-01-22 00:00:00,,"Several bottles of alcohol were seized from Fun Island Resort late Saturday by Maldives Customs Service, claiming that stocks from Royal Island Resort were transferred to the former illegally.
Maldives Police Service, Maldives Customs Services and the tax regulatory body Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA) have been raiding resorts operated by opposition Jumhoory Party’s (JP) leader Gasim Ibrahim’s Villa company since Thursday night.
General manager of Villa Hotels and Resorts, Gaisar Naseem, had said that although they had taken away several bottles of alcohol, it was not done legally. He said that they would comply with everything that fell within the law.
Since the first warrant expired, a second warrant had been issued by the Criminal Court’s judge Ali Adam, granting them five days to search the resorts. The warrant gave permission for Customs to check documents related to the resorts’ alcohol and pork stocks, and the computer systems that manage the stocks. None of the permits appeared to have granted permission to remove any of the goods from the resorts.
In an interview to Mihaaru, Gaisar stated that they did not understand why the alcohol should have been seized. He insisted that all the transferring had been done legally and that they had paid all the required taxes. Gaisar claimed that the Customs officers who came to Sun Island had said that the alcohol and pork could be taken from one resort to the other.
Since the state had taken action against Villa Shipping in March 2017, permits to import alcohol had been cancelled for all the resorts of Villa apart from Royal Island Resort, which is under Island Travels and Trade company; thus action was not taken against Royal. Hence, the goods imported to Royal Island had been distributed to the other resorts of Villa. Gaisar said that they had been doing this since last year and all the required legal steps were followed.
Customs stated that they took action against Villa Shipping under MIRA’s enforcement policy as they had failed to pay the required taxes. They also asserted that since pork and alcohol are imported under strict polices that require them to be sold at a specific location, it is illegal to transfer it to other places and sell.
Fun Island Resort’s manager Ismail Naseer said that it is not yet clear how many bottles of alcohol Customs had seized. He said that the officers came with a warrant to check the stocks, but had subsequently loaded a boat with several bottles from their out storage. Ismail declared that they would not cooperate with taking away goods from the resorts. He also noted that the officers had not answered any of the questions asked by their legal team.
The staff of Fun Island had protested while officers were conducting the raid, raising concerns over their employment. The residents of Alif Dhaal atoll Maamigili island, Gasim’s former constituency, also protested against the raids on Saturday, while members of the opposition held similar demonstrations in the capital, Male.

With the revocation of Royal Island Resort’s permit it carry alcohol and pork, the authorities have completely halted the import of these products to all of Qasim’s resorts.
A letter was sent from the economic ministry to Qasim, claiming that Royal Island had violated a clause in the regulations of pork and alcohol import, hence the permit had been revoked for six months, starting from January 21.
Maldives customs have accused Royal Island Resort of distributing the alcohol and pork imported for the resort, to the other resorts of Villa, and have already seized some of the alcohol in Fun Island Resort’s storage.
According to Gaisar Naseem, General manager of Villa Hotels and Resorts, the staff of Villa are planning to protest against the raids that are being conducted. He added that if alcohol and pork imports to the resorts come to an end, the resorts could no longer operate, leaving several people unemployed. Gaisar also encouraged others, especially tour operators to raise their voice against this.

Conducting an assessment of the general conditions of Maldivian prisons and detention facilities was one of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s first 100-day goals.
The PAC presented Minister of Home Affairs, Sheikh Imran Abdulla its prison audit report this Monday – which falls on the 100th working day of the new administration.
The report has not been publicly released, put a summary of the report was read to the press by a member of PAC, Ahmed Mohamed Fulhu.
Ahmed said the commission’s audit uncovered cases of corruption and brutality within the prison system.
“We noticed the existence of certain factors which facilitate acts of corruption in granting release to inmates and in providing certain services to inmates. We also noticed cases of brutality within prisons,” said Ahmed, speaking during a press briefing where the press was not allowed to pose any questions.
Ahmed said the PAC has recommended formal investigations and legal action in cases which came to its attention during the audit.
MAJOR CONCERN: PRISON OVERCROWDING
Ahmed said the main issue the commission noticed during its audit is the issue of prison overcrowding.
“This commission noticed the number of suspects and inmates detained at cells exceeded the general capacity level,” said Ahmed.
He said that the problem of overcrowding was leading to additional problems within the prisons.
Ahmed said the seven-member commission, following its review of the 390-page report compiled within 75 days, had made 180 recommendations for prison reform and improvement of prison conditions.
He said the majority of the recommendations were made towards solving issues related to inmate healthcare and general conditions of the prison.
“In summary, we noticed that the institutions charged with the management of detention facilities where people have been kept detained in a manner which undermines their independence in the past, as well as the independent institutions charged with oversight of these institutions, failed to execute their responsibilities to the fullest,” said Ahmed.
ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT
Corruption within the process of inmate release
Corruption within the process of services to inmates
Overcrowding
Deterioration of general conditions and additional issues as a result of overcrowding
Existence of acts of brutality against inmates
Discrimination in the award of constitutional rights to foreign inmates/detainees
Unfairness in the process of clemency and parole
“This commission’s biggest appeal is to implement the recommendations made in this report as soon as possible. And to release this report to the public,” said Ahmed.
Accepting the prison audit report from PAC, the Home Minister pledged to initiate work to implement the recommendations made in the report starting this Monday.
“We will not treat this as another addition to a bookshelf. We will consider the issues highlighted in this report, and with the Grace of Almighty Allah, make this report the basis to reform prison conditions,” said Imran.
He also pledged to release the report to the public as requested by the commission.
PAC was established by the Ministry of Home Affairs on December 18, 2018.

During a campaign event held last Friday night for Muaz Ibrahim Rasheed – PPM and PNC’s parliamentary candidate for the Madaveli constituency – Yameen said that despite not being able to travel to Madaveli due to current circumstances, he wished to speak to the people even if via a phone call.
He alleged that the “actions by the current administration” had prevented him from conducting campaign tours and touching campaign money.
“The administration is close to its fifth month but is yet to carry out any such [development] initiatives. What they keep doing consistently instead is travelling from one place to other, delivering speeches, and chasing abusing people. I have yet to see anything else,” said Yameen.
Yameen said that the current administration or anyone else did not need to “abuse people” in order to win at elections.
Yameen said that the current administration was a failure and that they “establishing this and that commission and carrying out illegal activities” to hide its failure.
“In five months, they have not done anything substantive. I know what I’m saying will direct heat at me again. But this is the reality, isn’t it?” he said.
Yameen said that his arrest and the freeze on his funds – which could have been utilized to campaign for the upcoming parliamentary elections – was a blatant violation of democratic principles.
He said that the lack of consideration of political leaders towards their constituents was the downfall of Maldives.
Yameen, who is now the country’s opposition leader, was charged with money laundering following two USD 500,000 deposits – totaling USD 1 million – made to his personal bank account at the Maldives Islamic Bank (MIB). The deposit was made by SOF Private Limited and is believed to be a fraction of the money embezzled from Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation (MMPRC) during his administration.
The Criminal Court initially granted the State an arrest warrant for Yameen on February 18 following evidence of witness tampering. The arrest warrant was annulled upon appeal by the High Court and he was released on March 28.

According to police statistics, 40 cases of sexual offences were reported in October.
Out of the 31 cases of sexual offences in September, the gender ministry received 24 cases of child sexual abuse.
Some 314 cases of sexual assault have been reported so far this year.

32,['Norton Norton'],2018-09-26 00:00:00,,"Voters in the Maldives delivered a stunning defeat for President Abdulla Yameen in a contentious presidential election on Sunday, an outcome regarded as a victory for democracy over authoritarianism in the Indian Ocean island nation.
Officials and analysts say the president’s infrastructure achievements – which include the South Asian country’s first bridge, new airports and harbours, as well as dozens of resort openings – were not enough to quell public anger over allegations of graft and a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent.
Yameen now joins a growing list of global leaders ousted this year amid public outrage over human rights abuses and corruption, including Malaysia’s Najib Razak and South Africa’s Jacob Zuma.
“We thought people would vote for us after they saw with their own eyes the development President Yameen brought to this country,” said Ahmed Nihan, leader of the ruling Progressive Party of the Maldives’ parliamentary group.
“We thought we would win. But the relentless accusations of theft cost us the election.”
Yameen – who lost by a margin of 16.7 per cent to his challenger and opposition candidate, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih – presided over the Maldives’ biggest-ever corruption scandal, in which at least $79m was stolen from tourism revenues. The money, obtained from leasing islands for tourism, an industry which accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s foreign earnings, was diverted to private accounts and embezzled, according to several audit reports, as well as a 2016 investigation by Al Jazeera.
The cash was then used to bribe legislators, judges and government officials, Al Jazeera’s investigation found. Associates of the president, in secretly filmed interviews, said they carried money to the president in black bags.
Yameen, however, denied any wrongdoing.
Nihan, the ruling party politician, maintained the president’s innocence and blamed former cabinet officials for the theft.
Yameen, who came to power following a disputed election in 2013, brought order and stability to a country riven by years of unrest since prison riots led to a democratic uprising more than a decade ago, Nihan said. And the president prevailed in forcing through his development agenda, despite challenges to his rule “from all sides”, he added.
Crackdown or enforcing order?
Indeed, Yameen’s five-year rule has been tumultuous by any measure.
He has jailed or forced into exile nearly all of his political rivals, arrested hundreds for protesting against his rule, suspended parliament for long periods of time, and shuttered independent and critical media. He claimed he was defusing attempts to topple a democratically elected government, but critics said the president was turning to autocratic behaviour to cover-up corruption.
Those jailed during Yameen’s tenure include his own vice president, Ahmed Adeeb, two former presidents, including his half-brother 80-year-old Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years, and Mohamed Nasheed, the country’s first democratically elected leader.
Two Supreme Court judges were also arrested during a state of emergency in February after the top court ordered the release of nine jailed dissidents.
Faced with widespread criticism, Yameen pushed through a draconian law on defamation and imposed more than $250,000 in fines on opposition-aligned Raajje TV for slander. He also pulled the Maldives out of the Commonwealth after threats of sanctions and moved closer to China and Saudi Arabia over traditional allies, India and the United Kingdom.
The crackdown united the four opposition political parties, who fielded a long-time member of parliament, Solih against Yameen. Solih promised to restore democracy, release dissidents and investigate corruption allegations against Yameen. In the run-up to Sunday’s vote, Solih said he was worried it would be rigged, but said he was sure voters would turn out in large numbers to say “no” to Yameen.
With so much hanging in the balance, why did the president contest an election that he could lose?
Niyaz Ibrahim, a former auditor general who lost his job after he flagged corruption in tourism leases, said Yameen was “convinced he could win”.
“He was fooled by his allies. They organised massive rallies, by intimidating and forcing government employees to attend,” Ibrahim said. “And that’s why he didn’t expect such a huge defeat.”
‘People said no’
Indeed, in a campaign rally in August, Yameen dismissed opposition’s allegations of autocratic behaviour, saying: “People wouldn’t be smiling and coming to greet me if brutality was commonplace on these islands and this nation.”
The president’s campaign, however, was carefully choreographed to avoid any public criticism. He avoided traditional electioneering such as door-to-door visits, and increased appearances at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for infrastructure projects, some of which were completed early on in his tenure, according to the Maldives Independent news website. In some islands, the opposition’s campaign banners were taken down and activists arrested in preparation for the president’s visit.
“We always knew Yameen could not win a popular vote,” said Moosa Latheef, long-time editor of independent newspaper Mihaaru. “The fear was that he would steal the election.”
“He brought unprecedented developments in infrastructure, but he also took away basic rights, jailed whomever he wanted, brought the courts under his control, and enriched his cronies.
“And that’s what people said no to.”
‘Lies and slander’
Latheef said he believed Yameen would have overturned the election if the outcome were not in his favour, but the huge margin for the opposition made that task impossible. He pointed to the president’s frequent warnings against accepting bribes for votes in the run-up to the election, as well as a police raid on the opposition’s campaign headquarters on the eve of the vote.
“Ahead of the vote, we heard some people in Yameen’s circles say he might lose, but that will still be inaugurated as president,” Latheef said, adding: “But the police, the army, the courts – they just couldn’t extend the president’s rule any longer given the margin by which he lost.”
Nihan, the ruling party politician, however, dismissed the allegations.
“Why would we allow a free and fair election if we were such thieves? Surely there is a no bigger prize worth stealing than an election.”
The opposition’s win on Sunday was proof the corruption allegations were “baseless”, he said.
“There was so much lies and slander during this campaign. But we didn’t take action because we thought we would win. Maybe we should have,” he said.

33,['Norton Norton'],2018-08-18 00:00:00,,"From research, I believe I am only the second person to write about living in the Maldives. Virtually all books about Maldives are travel guides or photographic works of the sea-life or the twenty-six atolls and 1,200 islands.
Between 2006 and 2017, I lived in Maldives (real name Dhivehi Raa’jeyge Jumhooriyya) for nearly three years and also visited a number of times. My writing experience consists of research and reporting degrees in humanities and interpersonal communication. The memoir is presented in a sardonic voice but not intended to be an attack on Islam; there are ‘jokes,’ but most of them are about me.
Living and working under my own auspices meant earning very low, local wages; years of self-funding for the pleasure of being treated like a fifth-class citizen despite recently-implemented employment regulations. I endured this ordeal to integrate with the local population, thus having a ‘real’ experience, not just a ‘touristic’ one.
The book chronicles the ghastly (and good) experiences had from living independently in the Maldives. The setting is a large rock, less than one square mile in size and home to upwards of 125,000 people. The background is the pervasive Sharia, a black market, substance misuse — the latter not surprising when there is nothing to do — virtual slavery and political upheaval.
On the positive side, for some years now, many Maldivians — female and male — have been supported to study abroad to doctorate level. And now there is also a university in Maldives with more and more teachers, etc., being created each year.
In the last dozen or so years, Maldives has been in fast-forward mode; regrouping following the 2004 Tsunami, the onset of democracy in 2008, followed by the reversion to autocracy in 2012. A society can alter very quickly when the capital is the size of a toy-town. And yet one wonders: what spurs people on when most of the land is now only one metre above sea-level? It may not be well-known that the current 1,200 islands are all that remains of an ancient mountain range; ‘new’ climate change is the least of it.

The Gaaf Dhaal Thinadhoo magistrate court’s decision to throw out the charges violated the constitution, as well as clauses in the Prosecutor General’s law and criminal procedures law. It cited clause 94 and 92 of the criminal procedures law and clause 15 of the Prosecutor General’s law.
An appeal was filed at the High Court on Wednesday.
The charges were thrown out last week without giving a reason. But local media reported that the court said it was because the deadline to press charges had ended.
The man was charged in February but a court hearing has not been held so far. The case was first submitted to a court in the man’s island in Gaaf Dhaal atoll but was transferred to Thinadhoo court in June.
He also faces an adultery charge for having sex with the mother of the four girls.
He was released in February after three months in custody, having been arrested in November.
In July the Prosecutor General’s Office also decided to press charges against the children’s mother and stepfather for parental negligence and for failure to report child sexual abuse.
Earlier this year the eldest of the four siblings told the Maldives Independent that “there is no hope for justice because of the system in the Maldives.”

36,['Norton Norton'],2018-09-21 00:00:00,,"The Environment Ministry signed Wednesday an MVR133 million (US$8.6 million) contract with the UAE-based Water Engineering Services FZE to establish drinking water facilities on 32 islands.
Facilities on seven islands will reportedly be funded from the state budget and loans from OFID. More than MVR104 million for the other 25 islands comes from the Green Climate Fund.
The 10-month project involves setting up tanks to store rainwater along with units to filter, disinfect and store clean water.
The contract was signed just three days before the presidential election.
But a project to deliver clean water to 30 per cent of the population with funding from the Green Climate Fund was signed with the UNDP in May 2017.
No new contracts have been signed since under the Green Climate Fund, UNDP confirmed to the Maldives Independent.
“The Maldives has only one GCF project supported by UNDP, entitled ‘Supporting Vulnerable Communities in the Maldives to Manage Climate Change-Induced Water Shortages,’” a UNDP official said.
“The project aspires to provide safe and uninterrupted drinking water for up to 49 islands of the Maldives.”
An environment ministry spokeswoman said the GCF funds were being utilised for the 32-island project. It was “hard to say” why it was not done sooner, she said.
The five-year project by the UNDP “targets 49 islands across 13 atolls of the Maldives that continue to experience water shortages linked to low rainfall and extended dry periods brought on by a changing climate.”
The 32 islands included in the contract with the UAE company are Kumundhoo, Vaikaradhoo, Nolhivaram and Makunudhoo in Haa Dhaal atoll; Holhudhoo in Noonu atoll; Inguraidhoo and Maakurath in Raa atoll; Himandhoo, Bodufolhuldhoo, and Mathiveri in Alif Alif atoll; Kuburudhoo and Dhigurah in Alif Dhaal atoll; Badidhoo, Meedhoo and Hulhudelhi in Dhaalu atoll; Vandhoo, Gaadhiffushi, Omadhoo, Kadoodhoo, Kibidhoo, and Dhiyamigili in Thaa atoll; Raiymandhoo, Veyvah and Naalaafushi in Meemu atoll; Nilandhoo, Maamendhoo and Kodey in Gaaf Alif atoll; Nadella, Hoadendhoo, Fiyoaree, Rathafandhoo and Fares-Maathooda in Gaaf Dhaal Atoll.

37,['Norton Norton'],2018-01-25 00:00:00,,"Two men in the Maldives have been sentenced to 40 lashes and a fine for drinking alcohol.
Hafiz Saeed and Ali Abdul Sattar, from Gaaf Dhaal Vaadhoo and Malé, were handed the flogging sentence Sunday by the Criminal Court.
The sentence said the two man had admitted to “regularly drinking alcohol” during a police investigation and repeated this admission in court.
As a result, they were sentenced to 27 days in prison and a flogging of 40 lashes.
The judge commuted the jail sentence to a fine of MVR5,400 (US$350), which has to be paid to the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority within a month. Failure to pay the fine within the period will result in the original sentence of 27 days in jail, the sentence said.
A Maldivian consuming alcohol or pork is a Class 3 misdemeanour, listed under Public Order and Safety Offences in the Maldives Penal Code. A convict may receive a jail sentence ranging from six days to three months.
The law also gives a judge the authority to pass an additional sentence of 40 lashes, as consuming alcohol or pork is a hudud offence – a crime which sets a punishment under sharia law.
Although the Maldives legal system is a combination of sharia law and common law, sharia sentences are uncommon.
An amendment brought to the Penal Code in 2015 requires all appeal processes be exhausted before Islamic sharia punishments can be meted out.
This means that the conviction must be upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court before it can be enforced, Criminal Court’s spokesperson Ahmed Mohamed Manik told the Maldives Independent.

In an announcement Tuesday, the economic development ministry urged shops not to sell the locally produced bottled mineral water at inflated prices. The price of a case has reportedly increased by up to MVR10 (US$0.60) in some corner shops.
Some shops also stopped selling water in early March and others have been rationing sales. Shops and businesses say daily supplies have been hard to purchase or entirely unavailable for delivery from the main producers.

“We had to go to the T-jetty, where they had a couple of palettes of water, and bring it to our café by ourselves,” he added.
With desalinated tap water unsafe to drink without boiling, the 150,000-strong population in the congested capital city rely on bottled water from three main suppliers – Island Beverages, Malé Aerated Water Company and Happy Market.
According to local media, the shortage in recent weeks was mainly caused by low supplies of the Taza or _Life _five-litre bottles bought by most households.
On Sunday, Happy Market told local media that the company’s production of the Life brand fell after a suction pump broke at its water plant on the island of Himmafushi near Malé.
But Managing Director Ali Ihusan assured that production will return to normal within a week. He also suggested that bulk buying of bottled water during the hot northeastern monsoon contributed to the shortage.
Temperatures have reached 34 degrees celsius during the past month.
Following the low supplies of the rival Taza brand in recent weeks, Ihusan said the demand for a five litre Life water bottle increased from 20,000 to 30,000 a day.
The withdrawal of a batch of Taza bottles due to a noticeable unpleasant smell in early March coincided with the problems at the Happy Market water plant.
At the time, the Island Beverages company temporarily suspended production of the five-litre Taza bottle.
But on Monday, Island Beverages assured the public that it has increased production of Taza bottles to maximum capacity.
The bottling plant is now operational for 24 hours, the company said. The government-owned Malé Water and Sewerage Company owns a majority stake in Island Beverages.
The State Electricity Company meanwhile introduced its bottled water to the market last week. But the state-owned company has limited capacity and is able to provide 10 cases per order daily.

In the Maldives, more than 280,000 plastic water bottles are used daily in the capital alone. Most households rely on locally produced bottled mineral water for drinking.
In partnership with the state-owned Waste Management Corporation, the Rahdhu (Return) project offers MVR1 for a bottle.
During the pilot phase from Tuesday to Saturday, only bottles with a particular sticker sold in shops, cafes and restaurants near the WAMCO office in Hulhumalé will be refunded, Ahmed Afrah Ismail, a spokesman from Rahdhu told the Maldives Independent.
The bottles have to be returned to the WAMCO office near Centro Mall or the waste disposal area in the northwest corner of Hulhumalé, a reclaimed island connected via a bridge to the capital.
“We will put out 10,000 bottles with stickers and see how many are returned,” Afrah said.
The team hopes to achieve a return rate of at least 80 percent. The results of the pilot programme will inform whether it could be rolled out nationally, he said.
In the future, the plan is to hand over the project to WAMCO to run as a consumer deposit scheme with a deposit of MVR1 being added on top of the cost of a water bottle.
The team hopes the project would also reduce the burden on WAMCO to keep the streets clean.
According to WAMCO, the company spends MVR2.5 million every month to collect litter.
The Rahdhu project is part of the smart city campaign run by Ooredoo and UNDP Maldives in partnership with the Hulhumalé Development Corporation. The litter management project was proposed during the urban innovation challenge last year as a solution to the challenge of plastic waste management.

According to the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative to the Maldives, Shoko Noda, the Game of Thrones star arrived in the Maldives on Sunday, to kick off the climate action journey. He was previously in Bangkok, Thailand, where he took part in the global goals world cup.
Coster-Waldau’s first stop after arriving in the Maldives was to Maabaidhoo island of Laamu atoll, where he was given a warm welcome.
In an Instagram post, Coster-Waldau said that he had “an inspiring and sobering visit on the island of Maabaidhoo,” adding that locals are in need of help as climate change causes “severe flooding and erosion is digging away at the island and without action this resilient beautiful culture is threatened“.

“We can help. We must help. Climate change affects us all. We must all share in finding solutions. Thank you so much for the welcome and tour of your island. We will pass on the message,” said the Game of Thrones star.
Coster-Waldau was appointed a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Goodwill Ambassador in September 2016, to raise awareness and support the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, also known as the Global Goals; an action to end poverty, fight inequality and stop climate change.
The father of two girls said that his main mission as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador “will be to raise awareness and support for the Global Goals for a better future for all, which cannot be achieved without empowering women and protecting our planet”.

COLOMBO: The newly elected Ibrahim Mohamed Solih government in the Maldives is likely to tread cautiously in foreign affairs particularly vis-à-vis India and China, even though foreign media is consistently portraying the regime change as one signalling the end of Chinese influence and the enhancement of Indian influence.
Given the defeat of the manifestly pro-China Abdulla Yameen in the September 23 Presidential election, foreign media reports blithely assumed that President Solih will swing towards India and the West abandoning China altogether.
Indeed, the optics on November 17, the day on which Solih was ceremonially installed as President, would have given such an impression.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the only Head of a foreign Government to attend the ceremony, and he was quite clearly the star of the show. In contrast, China was represented by the Minister of Culture and Tourism, Luo Shugang.
In his first speech to Maldivian MPs as President, Solih said: “We will endeavour to fortify the existing ties the Maldives has had with India and other regional countries.”
And India was the only country the President mentioned specifically.
In the half an hour bilateral between Solih and Modi, Solih told the Indian leader about the “dire economic situation” facing the Maldives and sought Indian investment in the housing and sanitation sector. On his part, Modi sought more opportunities for Indian companies to invest in the Maldives in different sectors.
It was announced that the Maldivian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdulla Shahid will make an official visit to India on November 26.
In a first positive pro-Indian step since 2013, Defense Minister Mariya Ahmed Didi said that the Maldives would not be returning the two Indian naval helicopters gifted to the country.
“It’s not in our culture to ask neighbours to take back what they give,” Mariya said.
Former President Abdulla Yameen had wanted the choppers out because he felt that its Indian crew were intelligence operatives.
Pressure From Nasheed
Former President and chief of the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) Mohamed Nasheed told Reuters that the new government will take a tough stance against China.
Lashing out at the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China entered into by the previous regime led by Abdulla Yameen, Nasheed said that it will be cancelled.
“The trade imbalance between China and the Maldives is so huge that nobody would think of an FTA between such parties. China is not buying anything from us. It is a one-way treaty,” Nasheed said, adding that parliament will not pass laws required for the zero tariffs agreement to come into force.
The Reality
However, going by what happened after a similar regime change in Sri Lanka and Nepal, and the statements of the new leaders in the Maldives, a radical anti-China swing is unlikely.
Experience in South Asia shows that parties which came to power playing the anti-China card tended to crawl back to China after a period of investigations into the terms of the Chinese contracts and loans.
In Sri Lanka’s case, the re-negotiated deal with China on the US$ 1.2 billion Hambantota harbour signed by the “anti- China” Wickremesinghe government, was vastly more favourable to China than the previous one negotiated by a supposedly “pro-China” Rajapaksa government.
China got Hambantota port on a 99-year lease and with a 70% stake in it, while Rajapaksa had offered only a 35-year lease in his time.
The US$ 1.4 billion Colombo Port City project, was heavily criticized during the 2015 Presidential and parliamentary elections as a White Elephant and as an environmental threat and was stalled for 16 months. But eventually, it was resumed with some modifications which were not really unfavourable to China.
The city area was extended from the initial 233 hectares to 269 hectares, and the land given to China was converted from freehold to a 99-year lease. The revised agreement gave China a greater role in the city’s development but in partnership with others.
In the Maldives, the 2 km long bridge between capital Male and the island of Huluhumale was highly criticized by the then opposition as an unwarranted investment. But it is proving to be a boon for overcrowded Male. Connected by the bridge, Hulhumale provides Male much-needed lebensraum. The all-weather bridge is helping Huluhumale develop as a satellite town relieving pressure on Male.
The Solih government is proceeding cautiously. Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid said: “The FTA has been already signed. So the government can only say anything after finding out all the details. If we say anything without finding out all the details it can harm relations between the two countries. So first, we must find out all the details before commenting.”
“We need to find out details of the loans and free aid given to us by China. We need to find out the weight of the loans and reshape the loan agreements in a way that we can carry them,” Shahid said.
According to customs statistics, the Maldives imported US$342 million worth of goods from China between January and August this year. Exports amounted to US$265,270 during the same period. This is by no means a “yawning” trade gap, Nasheed was complaining about.
In fact, the trade gap with his friend India is yawning. The Maldives imported $194 million worth of goods from India, its traditional partner, during the same period, while exporting $1.8 million of products.
With the MCFTA offering zero duty to fish exports, Maldives will be able to greatly expand fish exports to China. At present Maldivian fish exports overall are valued at US$ 121.5 million.
Nasheed May Not Be Decisive Factor
Nasheed, who is an incurable radical, may not have an influence on the Solih government as many people imagine.
Nasheed is a born agitator and is best in opposition, as his conduct as President between 2008 and 2012 showed.
President Solih and Foreign Minister Shahid are a different kettle of fish altogether. They are sober, practical and integrationist rather impulsive, idealistic and divisive.
“China has offered the most development assistance to the Maldives,” Solih reportedly told the Chinese Minister of Tourism who represented Xi Jinping at the inauguration. He mentioned various projects like the friendship bridge which have brought tangible benefits to the Maldives.
China Unfazed
Unfazed by the regime change, China has said it has a “firm and clear-cut will” to maintain good ties with the Maldives. It pointed out that during his meeting with the Chinese Tourism Minister, Luo Shugang, on November 17, President Solih had praised China.
The Chinese state-run Global Times daily said in an op-ed article recently, that “Solih is viewed as pro-India by the Indian and Western media. However, pro-India does not necessarily mean anti-China.”
“Due to close geographic distance, it is normal for India to have such a large influence on small Indian Ocean countries. China’s cooperation with these countries was never meant to replace India’s influence,” the article said.
“India and China should support these small countries in adopting a stable foreign policy and protecting foreign investment. The two nations can also carry out mutual third-party cooperation to seek a win-win scenario and stabilize the entire region,” the Chinese official daily said.
“Undoubtedly, China has its own stakes in the Indian Ocean as it is an important gateway for China’s opening-up. But China’s cooperation with Indian Ocean countries is not to squeeze out any other country,” it said.
China is the biggest investor in the Maldives. Chinese investments account for US$ 2.37 billion in a total FDI of US$ 3.22 billion.
It is perhaps this US$ 3.22 billion which is interpreted as the Maldives told debt to China, without considering the loan, interest and grant component of it.
India’s exports to the Maldives are just a wee bit lower than China’s. In 2016, Indian exports to the Maldives were valued at US$ 275,665, 477, while China’s were valued at US$ 285, 640, 637. But this similarity is ignored in the writings of commentators.
Writing in Global Times, Long Xingchun, Director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University and a Senior Research Fellow with The Charhar Institute said: “The Maldives may lend priority to India in its foreign relations, but it won’t constrain itself to India.”
“The building of infrastructure by China in the Maldives has created favourable conditions for the business and personnel of Indian companies on the island country. China and India can actually help boost Maldives’ development by using their own strengths.”
Two Plus One Formula
China has come up with a constructive “two-plus-one” mechanism, namely, China and India plus another South Asian country, as a demonstration of sincerity.
“This aims to harmonize relations between countries and serves the interest of all relevant parties and is worth a careful consideration by New Delhi. Perhaps the two powers can have a try in the Maldives first,” Long Xingchun wrote.

47,['Norton Norton'],2018-04-28 00:00:00,,"MALE’, MALDIVES – As the hammering, buzzing and whirring of construction drone on the outside – the soundtrack of a growing capital city – young people gather at Male’s Jazz Café to talk relationships, sex and family planning.
“Today we are going to talk about healthy relationships,” says reproductive health facilitator Azzam Mohamed before a full house. Around him, waiters serve free drinks to the 30 young women and men who have come to this session of ‘Safe Space’, a UNFPA-supported forum where youth can speak openly about topics they otherwise find few opportunities to discuss.
“Why do we marry at such a young age?” Azzam asks the group.
In the Maldives, men marry at age 25.8 on average, and women at 22.5, according to UNFPA analysis building on 2014 census data. But divorce is on the rise, and about 10 percent of young people aged 15-24 are already on to their second or third marriage. By the time they reach 25-29, 14 percent of men and 20 percent of women have married multiple times.
“Young people get married early because they long for privacy,” explains a young woman seated at the front table. “They live in very small apartments shared with their parents.” This seems to resonate with everyone.
In the Maldives, privacy isn’t the only thing reserved for married couples.
Marriage is a requirement for access to family planning services, and sources of adolescent- and youth-friendly information and services on sexual and reproductive health are scarce. The Society for Health Education (SHE), which hosts the Safe Spaces in collaboration with UNFPA, has the only such facility in Male’.
A safe space to explore sensitive issues
At today’s Safe Space, Azzam guides the conversation on to some difficult topics – using an interactive quiz that allows participants to answer anonymously, through their mobile phones.
“What is an unhealthy relationship?” he asks.
Most participants respond soberly: “When I am coerced into doing things I don’t want to do.” Others opt for a laugh: “When we have burgers for breakfast.”
Emotional manipulation and violence are less readily cited. It’s a sensitive topic. According to the Maldives Study on Women’s Health and Life Experiences, about 19.5 per cent of women aged 15-49 who had ever been in a relationship reported experiencing physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner, while 29 per cent reported emotional abuse. Six years ago this week, the Maldives ratified its first-ever Domestic Violence Act.
As the discussion unfolds, the young people have an opportunity to clarify the boundaries that separate a healthy relationship from an abusive one. “Pressuring someone to have sex against their will, even if you don’t use physical force, is rape,” says Azzam.
“Consent matters,” adds Aishath Zahira, who volunteered at SHE and is now a leading trainer on HIV/AIDS. “When a girl says ‘no’, that means ‘no’.”
Talking is the first step to healthy decisions
Azzam keeps the questions coming: “Where can we get contraceptives in the Maldives? Who’s responsible for buying them? How do you prevent an unplanned pregnancy?”
“Isn’t the couple supposed to support each other and discuss it together?” asks one of the young men.
Another objects – “You’re not supposed to talk during sex!” – making everyone laugh.
“Praying before and after sex might be a good idea, to help couples be on the same page and relax,” suggests another participant, echoing advice he got from a counsellor before he got married.
As the session comes to an end, Azzam urges the participants to become advocates for sexual and reproductive health. “Try to talk with someone about sexual assault, contraceptives, consent,” he says. Adolescent- and youth-friendly venues like Safe Space offer a cost-effective way to bring sexual and reproductive health services to more young Maldivians. UNFPA and SHE are looking for avenues to expand these kinds of services, both in Male’ and throughout the country.
Aishath Shaduna, 22, recently joined SHE and became a youth leader and advocate for sexual and reproductive health. “I am really happy to be part of this session,” she says. “I wish we had more opportunities like this, to talk openly about these important skills for making healthy life decisions.”

Security analysts may well outnumber sun-starved tourists doing Google searches for the Maldives after last week’s leadership showdown, which has raised the prospects of a proxy battle between India and China. The challenge to India’s blue-water naval power aspirations has been well covered, but what is less obvious is how the Maldives is the distant cutting-edge of China’s economic encirclement of India.
The Maldives’ exiled alternative president Mohamed Nasheed captured this nicely with his complaint that, “Without firing a single shot, China has grabbed more land than the East India Company at the height of the nineteenth century”.
As the accompanying chart shows, China dominates two-way trade with India’s neighbours, even if the margin is only modest in the Maldives. And now China is doubling down with infrastructure investment via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the Maldives; although Pakistan is, arguably, the real financial and operational frontline of the BRI.
Of course, this economic encirclement hasn’t always been smooth sailing, given how China’s backing of local, thuggish regimes was wrong-footed by elections in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. But the economic advance explains why China is arguing a no intervention line over the troubled Indian Ocean tourist paradise while India is agonising over whether to stage a risky intervention, like it did in 1988.
Ports in a storm
It says a lot about changing attitudes to the supervision of foreign investment that Darwin Port wound up under Chinese control without a formal Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) assessment in 2015. But now Newcastle’s port faces such a review because its Chinese owners are doing an internal corporate shuffle. China Merchants Port Holdings Company is buying a half share in the Newcastle port from its major shareholder, China Merchants Union.
It is normal for foreign investors to do this sort of box-ticking exercise when it comes to internal asset shuffles. However, this review comes after a substantial toughening of Australia’s foreign investment regime with the appointment of former senior intelligence official David Irvine as FIRB chairman; the creation of a critical infrastructure checklist; and implementation of the latest rules restricting the sale of farmland and electricity assets to foreigners.
These changes all followed the controversy over how Darwin Port was leased to the Landbridge Group without the sort of review that should have applied to a private asset. China Merchants Group owns Newcastle Port jointly with Hastings Funds Management.
But Chinese Merchants Group is a key player in the Chinese BRI infrastructure initiative for which the Australian Government has so far struggled to develop a clear policy, so the FIRB assessment may be more complex than normal. Meanwhile, Irvine, a former ambassador to China and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director, has sought to calm fears of a tougher approach to Chinese investment in recent interviews (here and here).
Irvine says people should not overstate the fact he has a background in dealing with China and the tougher new foreign investment rules. Two years after the government announced new critical infrastructure rules in response to the Darwin Port sale, those rules are still facing questions about how they will work in practice. Water and gas industry representatives recently expressed their concern to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security about confusion in the bureaucracy about the way the rules will work.
Drinking the cool aid
Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong had a dream run in the social media universe with her promise, made at this week’s Australasian Aid Conference, of higher development aid spending by a future Labor government. Predictably, there was much criticism of the big aid cuts under the current Coalition government and no reference to how the downturn in promised aid spending growth started at the end of the last Labor government, in 2012–13.
Given this historic reality, the cheerleaders might have paid a little more heed to Wong’s crucial qualifier:
We will, to the fullest extent that financial circumstances allow, rebuild and grow the Australian aid program in a timely manner.
It was also notable that Wong made no reference to the Labor for Aid campaign to have the party platform commit to increases in aid spending as a share of gross national income for every year it is in government.
Over the past decade or so, economist Stephen Howes has looked through the massive rise and fall in aid spending since the late Howard years and come up with a remarkable finding. Despite all the hype and subsequent institutional restructuring, growth has actually been about 1% a year, which is the same aid spending growth rate seen during the much more somnolent 1970s and 1980s. Given this looks like the new budget reality, it is probably more useful to look at Wong’s structural ideas.
Two things stand out. First, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop’s contribution to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s much-vaunted innovative nation – the separately housed innovationXchange for new aid ideas – looks set for the high jump. Second, given the fiscal constraints, it was notable that Wong did not embrace the emerging post-spending agenda of greater integration with the small Pacific countries at both the institutional and the labour mobility levels. This was an interesting but undercooked element of the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper.
Dry patch
India’s annual Economic Survey always contains a lucid, professorial-style ramble through some back corners of the economy, in a welcome respite from the usual political boosterism of the accompanying Budget. The latest edition contains a quite sobering analysis of the impact of climate change on agriculture, which has some interesting implications as Australia tries to build a new bilateral commercial relationship after the failed free trade deal negotiations. Perhaps to the chagrin of aspiring Australian food exporters, agriculture holds a mythic place in the Indian psyche. It is also just plain important, providing 49% of jobs and 16% of GDP.
So the finding from new research that climate change could cut farm incomes 15–25% is certainly a “stark” policy challenge. And this especially when the Modi government suddenly appears to be paying more attention to winning the votes of the vast rural population, after coming to office focused on the young, aspirational urban middle class. The survey argues the need for more irrigation to fend off this coming rural income slump, but concedes it will be “a defining challenge for the future” given water scarcity and inefficient existing irrigation schemes.
The first implication for Australia amid the Adani coal debate is that the top economic policymakers totally accept that climate change is happening and will impose some big costs on India. Perhaps more significantly, this research plugs directly into the emerging new thinking that Australia needs to focus more on engaging with India’s domestic economic reform priorities, and less on pursuing conventional trade and investment liberalisation.
Given this survey was overseen by the globally influential economist Arvind Subramanian, its call for more agricultural science education and better water technology should be directly addressed in the Australian Government’s new India Economic Strategy.

49,['Norton Norton'],2017-08-31 00:00:00,,"Richard Aspinall talks to Martin Stelfox from the Olive Ridley project about protecting one of the world’s smallest turtles from ‘ghost fishing’ in the Maldives
One of the world’s smallest turtle (some sources claim smallest is Kemp’s ridley) is also the most abundant, yet to me, it seems to be the hardest to find! I’ve dived on reefs across the tropics, with camera in hand, and have yet to encounter a single olive ridley. I’ve seen scores of hawksbills and greens, and even a few loggerheads, but the olive ridley, with its distinctive heart-shaped shell is an animal I’ve only come across in rescue centres. Is there a reason why turtles are facing different threats, based upon their species? Or is it more complicated than that? I reached out to Martin Stelfox, Founder of the Olive Ridley project (ORP).
“Olive ridleys are extremely rare to encounter when snorkelling or diving,” Stelfox told me, and I couldn’t help but agree, they are notable by their absence on the Maldivian reefs, so beloved of holidaymakers and researchers alike. Green turtles, such as the population at a wellknown diving spot called Kuredu Caves, are easily studied and even part of the ORP ID programme. Each turtle has a unique set of markings on the cheek and carapace, scuba divers can upload their turtle photos to add new individuals to the list and, get to name them too. Seeing greens or hawksbills while diving in the Maldives is pretty much the norm. The olives are much harder to find.

“Olives tend to be oceanic in nature, meaning they spend a considerable amount of time in deep water, foraging in deep habitats, looking for benthic organisms such as crabs and lobsters,” Stelfox says. He confirms my experience: hawksbills and greens favour shallower reef habitats. Primarily hawksbill turtles feed on sponges, with adult greens grazing on sea grass beds in the shallows. I have heard dive guides say that the less ecologically-minded resorts in the region will remove the sea grass meadows, which jeopardise the “white sand and turquoise seas” reputation of the resorts.
Is this why olives are at risk from entanglement in discarded fishing nets? Is it their life spent roaming further and in more open water that puts them at risk?
“In the Maldives, the majority of turtles we see entangled in floating ‘ghost’ nets are the olive ridleys. However, depending on the location and fisheries operating, this changes by region. For instance, fishing gear that is heavy and gets caught on coral reefs may be more likely to entangle greens or hawksbills. It’s just that olives are oceanic, putting them at a greater risk of interacting with floating debris, including ‘ghost gear’.”
Coming across discarded fishing gear, either under or below the surface is sobering. These pictures show a mass of old net, rope, cement bags and assorted plastic rubbish, tangled into a mass that has potentially wandered the ocean for months. This mass was brought to shore and disposed of by a nearby dive centre. Two turtles were cut free, the remains of two others were found, all were olive ridleys.

Stelfox, who is completing a PhD on the impact of ghost gear in the Maldives at the University of Derby, suggests it’s hard to estimate just how much debris is in the Indian Ocean. “There are very few studies currently underway,” he said. “Giving estimates of gear loss is also a difficult task. We cannot estimate right now, in 2009 the UN estimated around 640,000 tons of gear is lost globally every year, and the figure does not include gear loss from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.”
He says “ghost fishing” is not the only threat to olive ridleys; all species of turtle are at risk from ingestion of plastic debris. In the Maldives ghost nets appear to be the major threat to olive ridleys, but in the wider Indian Ocean this may not be the case.
“Bycatch is an issue that may be responsible for increased mortality rates of olives, however ghost gear has not yet been quantified in the region, so it is hard to say. The difficulty with estimating mortality rates from ghost gear is that most of the time the events go unnoticed and may happen out at sea.”
Add the threats to nesting areas from development and you have a combination of factors. Stelfox identifies coastal development on the east coast of India as severely threatening the species, despite the turtles’ schedule 1 status under Indian conservation law. “Despite protection there is little enforcement,” he adds.

Given the threats from discarded fishing gear, I asked which fisheries, if any, should consumers avoid? Should we consider eating less fish?
“The most important steps consumers can take is to become educated on the fisheries they are buying into and understand where fish comes from before buying it. If you cannot trace your fish back to a specific fishery or country, or you are unsure how the fish was caught, then you should avoid making the purchase. The majority of fish caught using nets will likely also contribute to the ghost net and bycatch problem to some degree.”

50,['Norton Norton'],2017-07-18 00:00:00,,"On the smooth, dark highway leading out of Sri Lanka’s Bandaranaike International Airport, Zaheena Rasheed slumped into the back seat of a taxi. Large fruit bats swooped under the streetlights. Out in the mangroves, egrets tucked their necks into moon-bright feathers. As the car sped through the cool September night toward Colombo—a city with about twice the population of Zaheena’s home country, the Maldives—her shoulders finally began to relax. For the first time in months, she felt safe. Twenty-four hours earlier, Zaheena had been in her office at the Maldives Independent, waiting to see if the Maldivian government would fall. While the Maldives slipped away from democracy throughout the latter half of 2016, journalists around the country had faced escalating legal and physical threats. As rumors of a potential military coup swirled, staff reporters texted Zaheena, the paper’s editor-in-chief, with updates from the streets, where citizens protested government corruption and recent crackdowns on free speech. The mood in the office grew somber. “The police were beating everyone, using pepper spray,” Zaheena says, “but that was it. There was really no critical threat to the president’s hold on power.”
Zaheena had recently been a source for an Al Jazeera documentary that claimed members of President Abdulla Yameen’s administration profited from a money-laundering scheme—an alleged abuse of power that had inspired protests. (In an email exchange with Pacific Standard, a spokesperson for Yameen denied all allegations of wrongdoing.) The documentary was due to air later that week, in September of 2016, and she’d been trying to decide if she needed to flee the country before it did. Yameen’s government had recently passed a law criminalizing defamation, in a move that David Kaye, the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of expression, called “a direct attack” that would make “reporting and criticism truly risky.” The day before the protests broke out, a member of the governing party delivered a warning shot on state television, suggesting contributors to the documentary would be arrested.
Until that evening, Zaheena had been ignoring the advice of concerned friends and family to leave. “I think it felt like backing down. It felt like giving into them.” But as she wrapped up editing the paper’s report on the failed protest, “It hit me how strong the government was. It suddenly felt urgent.” She called her fiancé to accompany her home from the office. “I was like, ‘OK, I have to leave now.'” Because of the risk of abduction—she had once been surrounded by a group of men trying to intimidate her on the street—Zaheena had to be careful not to go anywhere alone. The next morning, in her big, open, white-tiled kitchen, she told her parents about her decision to leave. “What she was doing was very risky,” Zaheena’s father Ibrahim Rasheed says. “I knew the threat she was going to face, but she wanted to [participate in the documentary], so I had to be OK with it.”
She packed a small suitcase—just her laptop, a couple of books, and some clothes. “I left thinking I was coming back the next week,” she says, hoping to give the documentary time to blow over. “Even as the plane was taking off, I didn’t think this was the last time I’d see my home.”
About 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka, more than a thousand islands rise from the warm, clear waters of the Indian Ocean. White sand beaches give way to palm trees, and coral reefs bloom in colorful bursts. Although the Maldives are a famed holiday destination, most of its resort-bound visitors don’t know that the Arab Spring came early here. In 2008, Asia’s longest-serving leader, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, was pressured by activists and international human-rights agencies into holding the country’s first multi-party elections, ending a rule of 30 years. Gayoom, who’d never previously faced an opponent, lost to Mohamed Nasheed, a journalist and activist who had been jailed several times for vocally opposing Gayoom’s regime. The non-violent transition, Zaheena says, imbued the capital island—a chaotic jumble of buildings, boats, and motorbikes—with a sense of hope. But democracy was short-lived.
As President Nasheed set out to investigate alleged abuses by the previous regime, he quickly tangled with the country’s top judges. Then, in the 2009 elections, Gayoom’s party won more seats in parliament than Nasheed’s, leading to political gridlock. “The people hadn’t changed,” says Aiman Rasheed, Zaheena’s brother, a former communications manager for Transparency Maldives, one of the primary non-governmental organizations in the country that focuses on human rights. “You can have a good constitution, you can have people working to change the system, but you can’t bring about change unless there’s a change in the attitudes and belief system—which doesn’t happen overnight.”
In early 2012, after Nasheed ordered the arrest of a criminal-court judge who he believed was working to protect Gayoom’s allies, protests erupted on a daily basis for weeks. Following a final showdown in the capital city between protestors, the military, and a police force apparently loyal to Gayoom, Nasheed claimed that he signed his resignation at gunpoint. The former vice president, an ally of Gayoom, took over and denied Nasheed’s account of his ouster.
In 2013, Nasheed staged a comeback, winning preliminary voting rounds in the presidential election before the Supreme Court delayed voting and annulled results amid accusations of vote-rigging. At one point, according to the New York Times, police blocked a rescheduled vote, surrounding the election commission’s offices. Eventually, an election commission appointed on the eve of the final vote declared a half-brother of Gayoom’s, Abdulla Yameen, the winner.
After Yameen took office, Nasheed was convicted and sentenced to 13 years in prison, under broadly written anti-terror laws, for the arrest of the criminal-court judge. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, characterized the trial as “a rushed process that appears to contravene the Maldives’ own laws and practices and international fair-trial standards in a number of respects.” Zaheena covered the trial. “It happened really late at night, because they didn’t want people to know what’s happening.” She’d enter a small courtroom that had a big plaque on the wall “with a Byronic phrase, you know, something like ‘rule justly.’ You’d witness this great injustice under these words. I was just flabbergasted.”
Nasheed didn’t seem to be the only Maldivian who felt threatened by the new president. “The president is going after each one of his popular rivals,” a former member of parliament told the New York Times in 2015. Even during the 2013 elections, Zaheena says, “People were still talking on record, still willing to have their names published. It changed quite quickly in the couple months after Yameen took power.” (Yameen’s spokesperson told Pacific Standard that his administration has “consistently shown commitment to multi-party democracy.”)
In 2013, the new president appointed a man named Ahmed Adeeb as tourism minister—a powerful position given the country’s economic dependence on visitors. Fond of flashy watches and the sobriquet Bro, Adeeb called himself “boss of all gangs in the Maldives,” according to text messages obtained by the Al Jazeera documentarians who interviewed Zaheena.
Under Yameen, the country’s judicial system continued to receive criticism from Western observers for its lack of independence. Corruption charges against a Gayoom ally were dropped. According to financial and legal documents as well as cell phone records also obtained by Al Jazeera, only a few months after Adeeb’s appointment in late 2013, he and other government officials began selling government-owned islands, allegedly pocketing millions from the proceeds. In email exchanges with the documentarians, Adeeb’s attorney denied any wrongdoing; the attorney did not provide responses to Pacific Standard‘s written list of questions by press time.
But years before the Al Jazeera documentarians began looking into the alleged embezzlement scheme, Niyaz Ibrahim, the country’s auditor general (appointed by Nasheed in 2011), came upon suspicious financial transfers and began to investigate where the government’s money was going.
When I met Ibrahim at a Colombo Burger Hut diner in February of 2017, he recounted how it all started, speaking in a solemn whisper at odds with the cheery red pleather décor. Back in 2014, about a year after Yameen took office, Ibrahim’s office conducted an audit of the tourism ministry after a member of the public filed a complaint. He found that the ministry used Excel to maintain records of payments—meaning there was no easy way to trace changes made over time—and provided receipts without dates, stamps, or signatures. His audit report in October of 2014 stated, “Corruption suspected.”
Ibrahim had uncovered part of what the 2016 Al Jazeera documentary would later reveal to the world: Around $80 million intended for the Maldivian government—proceeds from the sale of small islands to luxury hotel chains—was deposited into a main account before being siphoned off into private accounts owned by members of Adeeb’s family. When Ibrahim first started prying, according to Al Jazeera, Adeeb texted his collaborators: “u guys need to focus on this auditor general.” A member of the Maldives Police Service warned Adeeb that Ibrahim’s office had security cameras. Adeeb didn’t care. “Need to blast it at any cost,” he texted.
Ibrahim was alarmed by the outcome of his investigation, but “I never imagined the scale,” he says, shaking his head. On the night the report was initially published, several of Ibrahim’s family members were texted death threats. Shortly thereafter, the parliament passed an amendment that gave the president the option of cutting Ibrahim’s term short and appointing a new auditor general. Yameen took this opportunity and selected the brother of a man implicated in the money-laundering scheme with Adeeb.
As the Maldives Independent covered the unfolding scandal, Zaheena frequently called Ibrahim, but cooperating with the media felt like a risk. Ibrahim told Zaheena he couldn’t comment on particular lines of questioning because he had three young children at home to protect. When the documentary journalists asked Ibrahim for an interview, he knew there’d be repercussions. Still, he agreed. “I had a moral responsibility,” he says.
Even Yameen’s closest political advisor turned out not to be safe. In 2015, Adeeb—by then the country’s youngest vice president in its history—was arrested on charges of treason for allegedly planting an explosive device on the presidential yacht. Evidence from two separate forensic analyses, including from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States, suggests that the blast was accidental and that Adeeb was imprisoned on false pretenses. When Adeeb was arrested, an anonymous source managed to get the data from three of his cell phones to Will Jordan, an Al Jazeera journalist. The unprecedented evidence prompted Jordan to direct the feature-length documentary on the state’s alleged acts of corruption. (In press reports, Adeeb’s attorney denied the treason allegations.)

Stealing Paradise aired in early September of 2016, a few days after Zaheena fled the Maldives. She had just finished watching the documentary on YouTube in a friend’s living room in Colombo—and was on the phone with her office trying to decide how to cover it—when the police pounded on the paper’s door. The Independent’s headquarters were raided. Because the search started in a different part of the building, her colleagues had time to hide their laptops in a third-floor advertising agency, saving them from confiscation. “I was in shock,” Zaheena says. “When you are far away out of harm’s reach and feel like you’re putting other people in danger….” She trails off.
She texted the former auditor general, who, as the other primary Maldivian source for the documentary, was now in danger. She warned Ibrahim that he needed to flee the country immediately.
Ibrahim says he headed to the airport, but had trouble checking in. Airline staff at the counter looked him up in their computer system. There was a hold on his passport. Ibrahim demanded to see a court warrant and anxiously texted friends. He was kept sitting in a corner for 30 minutes. “I thought, This is the end of the story,” he says, but since no one had the appropriate paperwork, he was eventually allowed to leave. He got on the next plane out of the country, a flight to Singapore, and then boarded another for Colombo. “Some of the officers must have been sympathetic,” Zaheena says. “He was lucky.”
Ibrahim stops talking as the waiter approaches our table at the restaurant, and continues only when we’re alone again. “Some of the murders linked to [the Maldivian] parliament took place here,” he says, explaining his caution. He and Zaheena are two of roughly 10,000 Maldivians living in Colombo, and violence from home has reportedly followed people to Sri Lanka before. Ibrahim tries to avoid going out alone, but he has a family to support and is still looking for work. “I have to take them to school,” he says. “Things have to be done.”
We leave the café into the afternoon’s dusty heat. A tuk-tuk selling baked goods tootles by, blasting electronic “Für Elise” through tinny speakers. “Every project they take is underlined with corruption,” Ibrahim says, making it difficult to foresee things in the Maldives getting better. “Either you’re with the current regime, or you’re with the opposition. Very few people are in the middle.”
Though many are fed up with the political system altogether, the opposition is disorganized and fractured. “All the options are bad. You don’t find many sources of information. Very few people are willing to speak up.” He steps into the crowded street to try to flag down a ride, to no avail, and returns to stand in the shade, staring out over the chaos. “I don’t know what’s wrong with the Maldives. I don’t know why people tolerate such things.”
Five years to the day after Nasheed’s fall from power, Zaheena sits on a white couch in Colombo, hunched over an Apple laptop with a sticker commemorating a disappeared colleague. She’s trying to prepare for an interview with the former president, who received medical leave from prison to travel to the United Kingdom, where he was granted asylum. Since leaving the Maldives, Zaheena’s lived with a rotating circuit of friends and fellow exiles, in London and Colombo. In her current hosts’ living room, a hand-penciled sign on a cluttered desk proclaims “Editor”; at a low table nearby, her host’s young son has set up another desk with toys and his own name on it. As Zaheena continues to edit the Maldives Independent remotely, she spends hours every day in the living room, working on Skype, WhatsApp, and Google Drive. A dog whines intermittently at the door; her hosts come and go. Though Zaheena has managed to restore a semblance of normality, the smallest things are off: She works on Sundays because the Maldivian weekend is Friday and Saturday. Sri Lanka is a half-hour ahead of the Maldives, so every time she schedules a phone call with a source she’s reminded that she’s reporting on her own country from abroad.
Illiberal democracy is not a new concept for Zaheena; she was born on Rathafandhoo, a small fishing island in the southern Maldives, and grew up in the heyday of Gayoom’s rule. “We had electricity four hours a day, no running water, no toilets. I had a very idyllic childhood, playing on beaches,” she says. But her parents wanted their children to be properly educated, so they moved to the capital island and rented a small place. “Like living in a slum,” Zaheena’s brother Aiman recalls. “That’s where we grew up. There were certain things you saw that had a lasting impact on you.”

At 15, Zaheena won a scholarship to finish high school at a United World Colleges school in the hills of Pune, India. “It was the first time I’d left the country. I’d never had a passport or been on a flight. I was like a sponge, absorbing everything.” It was this world-expanding experience that piqued her interest in fighting injustice at home. At the time, the Maldives didn’t have a degree-awarding university and, when she graduated, she was accepted to Middlebury College (an institution I also attended) in Vermont.
After her freshman year, she decided to take a year off, and returned to the Maldives in time for the country’s first free presidential elections in 2008. She took an internship at what was then called Minivan (“independent” in the Maldivian language Dhivehi) News, and which was later renamed the Maldives Independent. From the start, she focused on abuses of power, including corruption in a tourism wealth-redistribution project. “I could see what potential she had,” says Will Jordan, then working as an editor at Minivan. (Jordan respected her work so much that when the British journalist returned to the Maldives to produce the Al Jazeera documentary, he tapped Zaheena as one of his primary sources.) As a result of covering the elections, Zaheena learned the constraints that come with journalism are important. “People put blinders on the moment they are part of a cause,” she says, and her experiences reporting on politics demonstrated the importance of unbiased sources.
But when she graduated from Middlebury and returned to the Maldives to work for the paper again in 2013, Zaheena soon learned that, when your own publication is under attack, remaining impartial can be hard. In 2014, her colleague, Ahmed Rilwan, disappeared. After criticizing both government policy and radical Islamists, Rilwan was forced into a car at knifepoint, eyewitnesses told the press. “The government refused to acknowledge he’d been abducted, even though it was reported within minutes, and a knife was recovered from the spot,” Zaheena says. Just before Rilwan disappeared, they had collaborated on a story about vigilante mobs that were carrying out abductions of online activists advocating for secularism. (As the deputy editor, she had often worked closely with Rilwan.) “He was a great writer, always quite interested in stories that had to do with disadvantaged groups,” she says.
People were “very quick to dismiss what we write as alarmist, but history has proven us right,” she says. “In many ways we weren’t alarmist enough. This is something American journalists will have to keep in mind.”
Zaheena and a group of Rilwan’s friends and family took the lead in finding out what happened, tracking down witnesses, but the official investigation proceeded slowly. Almost a year later, the police suggested that a reported kidnapping near Rilwan’s apartment on the night of his disappearance wasn’t linked to his case. Local reporting on the case says it wasn’t until 600 days after he was last seen that the police even referred to the incident as an abduction.
When Zaheena uncovered new information, “we always reported it to the police and didn’t report it on our website until some [other media outlet] reported it,” she says. “When you’re the one countering the [official] narrative,” she says, “in many ways, that’s what journalists do. But when it’s a member of your team, and you’re emotionally invested in the story….” She pauses, before adding that covering Rilwan’s disappearance was “the most difficult thing I’ve ever done.” After the Maldives Independent published a third-party report on Rilwan’s disappearance, Zaheena says, a CCTV camera outside the paper’s office was destroyed, and a rusty machete was found lodged in the door. An eyewitness saw two men flee on a motorbike after leaving the machete in the early afternoon. The same day, Zaheena says, she received a text message that read: “you will be the next one to be killed/disappeared.”
Nevertheless, Rilwan’s family tried to keep pressure on the government, but they began to fear that they were becoming targets too. Rilwan’s brother Moosa was assaulted and then, after fleeing on his motorcycle, chased through the streets. After narrowly escaping, he heard from a girlfriend of a gang member that another attack was planned, and fled the country. “I no longer feel safe,” Moosa writes in an email.
“That’s the thing,” Zaheena says. “That’s why it’s so fishy. Everyone who’s tried to find him has also come under threat.”
Through a spokesperson, Yameen denied playing any role in the intimidation of journalists or the auditor general. “This Administration is under no illusion that it somehow has the authority to orchestrate such actions—nor would it take example from previous administrations in exceeding, or going beyond, such authority,” the spokesperson wrote.
Rilwan’s case is technically still open, but it has been months since the family has heard from the police. The waiting is hard. “When someone’s dead, we know that it’s over,” his brother writes in an email, “but in an abduction case like this, there’s no closure.” Moosa still sometimes talks about his brother in the present tense, explaining that journalism is an important part of who he is. “[Rilwan] can see clearly how things are going wrong in our society,” he says, “which he believed can only be changed by confronting them. He can’t stand to watch people suffering. Let’s say he believed in humanity…. My brother was working toward a more tolerant society than what we are today.”
But tolerance under an autocrat has been in short supply. The month before Stealing Paradise aired, Will Jordan, the Al Jazeera producer, says he received a tweet reading: “U will die soon. We have hired some gunmens to shot u. & we r not afraid of fucking anyone or any country. See the bullet.” The words were followed by a gun emoji.
Just weeks before this story went to press, 29-year-old Yameen Rasheed, an outspoken political blogger who was also a friend of Rilwan’s, was stabbed to death in the stairwell to his apartment. The last time Zaheena spoke to Rasheed (no relation), “we talked about marking the 1,000 days since Rilwan disappeared,” she says. Rasheed had made repeated reports of death threats to the police, but, he told the New York Times before his murder, the government was unresponsive.
“Western journalists for a long time could afford to have a distance to crazy political issues,” Zaheena says. But with rhetorical and procedural attacks against the press in democratic countries becoming more common, that distance may become harder to maintain. “Obviously you can still hold fast and true to principles of journalism, but unless it happens to you, you don’t know [what it’s like]. You also have to grapple with your own … ‘Shit, what’s happening to me? What’s happening in my country? What’s happening to the people I love?'”
Yameen’s drift away from democracy seems to reflect an evolution in the dictator’s playbook. The old totalitarian model—the one taught in high school history—was based on a Stalinist state ownership of means. The 21st-century model is quasi-democratic. “Now comes the illiberal version,” says Miklós Haraszti, director of research on human rights at the Center for European Neighborhood Studies of Central European University—and a Hungarian who watched his own country transform into a populist autocracy. “There are plenty of names for it, but they all mean the same thing. It’s a new state culture, operating through the semblance of democracy.” A strongman raises red-herring issues as he consolidates power, while citizens stand by, either too side-tracked or too attached to a blind faith in an increasingly corrupt government. In this kind of regime, “civil society is the main obstacle,” Haraszti says—and therefore an early target.
Haraszti’s theory seems to neatly fit the Maldives’ political revolution. “Dictatorships find their biggest enemy is the truth,” Zaheena says. “So they go after the people who criticize them.”
The 2016 edition of the World Press Freedom Index, published by Reporters Without Borders, suggests a “deep and disturbing decline in respect for media freedom at both the global and regional levels.” The report states that “independent news coverage is becoming increasingly precarious.” Governments are purchasing media outlets, and courts are penalizing journalists on spurious charges. “There’s an increasing desire worldwide to control the narrative, and it often puts journalists at risk,” says Courtney Radsch, advocacy director at the Committee to Protect Journalists. “We’ve seen historic levels of killings of journalists, historic levels of imprisoning.”
In response to such risks, Haraszti explains that journalists inevitably begin to fall into two categories: toeing the line by creating propaganda for state channels and regime-supporting oligarchs—”Food for the machine,” he says. Or sheer escapism, media “that’s serving the system by excluding all politics, creating the semblance of pluralism. It’s shiny, celebratory.”
By fostering such polarization, regimes are able to isolate opposition and control protests. “The Maldives is only a democracy on paper,” says Mariyam Shiuna, executive director of Transparency Maldives. “There’s no freedom of expression, no freedom of assembly, no freedom of press. Obviously you see a lot of media operating, but everyone’s drawn certain boundaries for their own safety.”
One of the first freedoms to go is what Haraszti calls “the right to know”: The government restricts fact-finding by denying access to government-owned data, retaliating against whistle-blowers, and restricting access to information on the regime’s behavior. The International Commission of Jurists argued that the auditor general’s firing in 2014 was an example of this kind of retaliation. “The failure to adhere to the constitutionally prescribed process for removal of an official,” the report states, “raises serious concerns with respect to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.”
Silencing can also occur under less conspicuous circumstances. Haveeru, one of the Maldives’ oldest newspapers, published articles on some of the capital island’s gang activities. A lawsuit over the paper’s ownership before the high court resulted in the deletion of the paper’s digital archive. Shortly thereafter, its offices were lit on fire, destroying one of the largest physical archives in the country, covering 37 years of history.
“I was just incredibly paranoid. That’s what dictatorships thrive on, uncertainty,” she says. “Fear keeps people in line. Fear is so much more important [than actual violence], because it keeps you wondering.”
Under these kinds of regimes, leaders with dictatorial aspirations use the trappings of former democracy—like once free and fair judicial systems—to cover undemocratic uses of power. Political scientist Douglas Payne calls this “market authoritarianism,” where market economics are still allowed to flourish but power is maintained through corruption of institutions, intimidation of the press, and, inevitably, violence. The Maldives’ recent law forcing journalists to face prison time for defamatory speech, and providing a legal rationale for silencing government criticism, is an example of the state using the courts to perpetuate control.
The instability and appearance of corruption has left the Maldivian people disillusioned. While reliable third-party surveys of corruption in the Maldives are notoriously hard to produce, a poll conducted for Transparency International found that 94 percent of Maldivians believe that politicians are ready to lie to get elected. Similarly, 71 percent of Maldivians agree that the government does not care much about ordinary people. According to another poll conducted for Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer, 78 percent of people consider the legislature corrupt, and 69 percent of people feel similarly about the judiciary. That doesn’t bode well for the future. “We need people to trust these institutions for them to work properly,” says Aiman Rasheed, Zaheena’s brother. “But people can’t trust in the systems because they don’t function properly.”
In this kind of environment, journalists have to learn which battles to pick. “We definitely see self-censorship as a problem,” Radsch says. “Why we have a problem with leaders using negative rhetoric or vilifying the press is because we see that having a chilling effect.”
When journalists do fight back, it can go poorly. In April of 2016, several months before the documentary aired, Zaheena and dozens of other Maldivian journalists decided to protest abuses of the press outside Yameen’s office. “We were pepper sprayed, and pushed back,” Zaheena says. She and about a dozen others were arrested and taken to jail. “They gave you half a bar of soap, a worn orange towel, toothpaste, and a toothbrush.” The walls of her holding cell were covered in toothpaste graffiti, and among scrawls of gangsters’ names and “Fuck the police,” someone had written “Happy New Year 2016.” “That really affected me,” she says, “thinking about that person who’d spent that New Year’s night in this cell.” Due in part to pressure from international friends—multiple diplomats called the foreign minister—she was released after 10 hours.
Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Department of State brought Sri Lankan and Maldivian journalists together at an event where Zaheena met Dharisha Bastians, a reporter from Colombo. Sri Lanka had recently come out of a civil war in which journalists had been murdered and disappeared. Zaheena found a kindred spirit in Bastians as the pair discussed their respective challenges, and Bastians gave Zaheena some hard-won advice. “You just have to do your job, essentially,” Bastians told Zaheena. “And sometimes that also means making sure that you stick around to do it on another day.” Though it’s easy to get carried away with big gestures of bravery, in Bastians’ opinion, the fight against injustice is won through caution. “That’s not courage, it’s commitment,” she says. “Tyrants die by a thousand cuts.”
“That conversation was so important to me,” Zaheena says. As someone with the privilege of an education and international networks that make her a public and thus somewhat protected figure, she feels pressure to use that privilege to stand up to the government, often putting herself at risk. But Bastians’ reminder to play the long game was sobering.
If democracy is restored, Bastians says, “the Maldives is going to need people who are independent journalists who can still speak truth to power, because there is so much work to restore those systems after a dictator falls.”
In February of 2017, as Zaheena started dinner in a friend’s kitchen in Colombo, searching assorted drawers for cutlery, raven-sized bats swooped past the room’s large glass doors. What she misses most about Maldivian food is a certain kind of chili. “I think you have to be South Asian to understand all of these countries have a different spice,” she says. “I didn’t realize that it was a thing until I left. But Sri Lankan spice and Maldivian spice are completely different.”
It took some time to feel out the shape of her loss. Meena (whose name has been changed to protect her safety), a close friend, says that, when Zaheena first arrived in Colombo, she was remarkably matter-of-fact. It wasn’t until a few days in, after Zaheena helped the auditor general flee, that she broke down. Once Ibrahim was safely on a flight, she started shaking. “I didn’t know whether to hold her,” Meena says. “Then I went over and hugged her and told her she can cry as much as she wants, and she started laughing. And crying again. And laughing.”

After feeling helpless for so long, the anxiety began to take a toll. Zaheena stopped sleeping. She had panic attacks. In her final months in the Maldives, she had stopped seeing friends or going out. “I was just incredibly paranoid. That’s what dictatorships thrive on, uncertainty,” she says. “Fear keeps people in line. Fear is so much more important [than actual violence], because it keeps you wondering.”
Zaheena’s wedding, originally scheduled for December of 2016 in the Maldives, had to be moved to Sri Lanka. To make matters worse, her grandmother fell ill. “I lived with her when I was in the Maldives,” Zaheena says. “The last time I saw her, she was healthy.” Because Zaheena’s mother was her grandmother’s primary caretaker, her mom was going to have to miss Zaheena’s wedding. Then, two days before the event, Zaheena’s grandmother died. “Not getting to say goodbye, because I can’t go back home,” Zaheena says, and then pauses. “It’s been really weird to be here.” In the midst of everything, she coordinated an investigative journalism class in the Maldives from afar, while Meena went shopping for her wedding dress.
“These last couple of years have just felt like throwing yourself up against this massive wall and not making any cracks,” Zaheena says. “I’m just exhausted.” She found a knife and diced potatoes into the sink. In a small victory, the Independent’s coverage of judicial trials has been used by non-governmental organizations, including Amnesty International, as evidence of rights abuses in the Maldives. But, Zaheena says, “At the end of the day, I’m here, the newsroom is really struggling, morale is low, everyone’s really tired … and Yameen’s still president.” People were “very quick to dismiss what we write as alarmist, but history has proven us right,” she says. “In many ways we weren’t alarmist enough. This is something American journalists will have to keep in mind. Don’t give in to those labels.”
Her visa in Sri Lanka was running out. She was about to move to Doha, Qatar, where Al Jazeera had offered her a job. “I just need to be able to know I’m sleeping in this room and waking up at this time and have a visa to stay in this country,” she says. She wanted to learn Arabic, to spend time catching up on television and reading books, to know “what I’m going to do tomorrow, and come back to my own bathroom, do you know what I mean?”
The potatoes sizzled. The steak roasted. She set the table and a group of friends, all Maldivians far from home, sat down to eat. Inevitably, the conversation turned to politics. Her host, an older man with short-cropped hair who had also fled government persecution, said: “We failed. All of us, the people. We have given Yameen and Gayoom the space to do this.” Zaheena, who had been arguing optimistically that there was still a chance for change, shook her head. “I ask myself,” she said, looking around the table, “what could we have done differently?”

51,['Norton Norton'],2017-06-10 00:00:00,,"Illustration: Derek Bacon
It was October 2007. I was exhausted and needed a holiday. I’d always wanted to visit the Maldives, so I booked a trip. The only thing unique about any of this was that I was travelling alone. I was heading to the Most Romantic Destination in the World on my own. But it didn’t bother me: I’ve always been comfortable in my own company. And I had spent the past decade so focused on building a career as an ad filmmaker that vacations—and a love life—had simply slipped by and I didn’t even notice. So when I made the decision to actually go, the last thing on my mind was the fact that I was going alone. If anything, I was thinking about my father, and the incredible travels we had shared while I was growing up: glamorous trips to Thessaloniki, St Moritz, Vaduz and Dublin. At a time of great political instability, we took a road trip from Lagos to Lome to Cotonou. My father was a brilliant conversationalist, and our lunches would often take up most of our days. He’d teach me about wine, and we’d often end our meals with sambuca. Over time, we became estranged, but what had continued was my drinking—heavily. Alcohol had become a companion; it also enabled me to fly solo. I didn’t have to think about anyone else—and there was nobody to tell me off for having one too many.
So when I arrived at the exquisite resort in the Maldives in 2007, the first thing I did was go to the poolside bar and order a beer. Clouds were looming and all around me were couples. Speaking softly, practically in whispers. Smiling. Laughing. Many weren’t even drinking, just sharing each other’s company in what seemed to me a deafening silence. There was no music. No sign of a party. Just peace and contentment. As I sipped my beer, discomfort came over me—the opposite reaction of what usually followed a swig.
I went to my large room, which opened out to a private deck with a staircase into the sea. I napped. When I woke up, I wondered what to do. There was a bottle of Black Label above the mini-bar, looking over at me. I poured warm whiskey over three ice cubes—a familiar, comforting action—and sipped a familiar, comforting taste. And then, a powerful sense of rejection burned inside me. I carried the glass over to the sink and poured the whiskey out. I opened my laptop and began to type: “This is the last drink you’re ever going to have. Remember how you’re feeling right now.”
It wasn’t that I had an epiphany that day in that beautiful place. It had been a persistent building up of what felt like manageable pain. But that afternoon, enveloped in beauty, among people who seemed so happy, so comfortable baring their souls to each other, I had a singular thought: all these years, I had believed that alcohol enhanced my life when actually, it was preventing me from enjoying it.
I left the Maldives with great intentions, but truth be told, it took more than a year of struggle for me to actually quit drinking. And when that moment came, it wasn’t a happy ending, either—much like a wedding, it’s actually the beginning of a new journey, with highs and many lows. I found myself trapped in a fortress of fear. What would I do at parties? Whom would I hang out with? How would I travel? I associated all these things with drinking and didn’t know how to get through life without it.
It took time for me to realise that alcohol was a crutch. What was imprisoning me was the fear of opening my heart. It was easier to be on my own, inside my fortress, than to share my vulnerabilities and fears with another person. Things began to change slowly, excruciatingly. Sober, no matter how hard it got, I knew I was experiencing my life fully. I had some slip-ups, but I got back on track. It’s now been four years since my last drink. I’ve fallen in love, had my heart broken, switched gears at work, taken up street photography, even worked up the courage to make a movie after 17 years. The fears that plagued me for years have fallen away. I have a fresh energy that lets me see the world differently.
I’ve had so many dreams come true that would have been impossible before that trip to the Maldives. Yes, it is a fantastic place to visit with someone you love. But sometimes, if you’re lucky, travel will enable you to love yourself.

52,['Norton Norton'],2018-12-11 00:00:00,,"The Anti-Corruption Commission has instructed various government offices to recover more than MVR2 billion (US$129 million) owed to the state.
The missing funds were identified in 27 probes concluded during the first three quarters of 2018, the watchdog revealed in a statement Monday.
Four cases involving MVR1.8 billion were forwarded to the Prosecutor General’s office to press criminal charges earlier this year.
Transparency International says the Maldives has made little to no progress to combat corruption, falling 17 positions in country rankings.
Its local chapter Transparency Maldives said only one corruption-related case reached conviction between 2010 and 2014, despite 175 cases being submitted for prosecution by the ACC.

At the meeting with Mark Field MP, minister of state for Asia and the Pacific, the pair “discussed the UK providing assistance for asset recovery efforts and to strengthen and reform the security services, institutions and the judiciary,” according to the president-elect’s office.
The recovery of stolen public funds, including nearly US$80 million embezzled from the state-owned tourism company, was a campaign pledge of Solih.
He is due to take the oath of office on November 17.
The president-elect also met EU ambassador Tung-lai Margue and French ambassador Jean-Marin Schuh, both of whom are based in the neighbouring Sri Lanka.
Solih expressed gratitude for the EU’s efforts for democratic reform in the Maldives and discussed assistance in reforming institutions and climate change adaptation projects. With the French ambassador, he discussed strengthening bilateral ties and increasing tourist arrivals from France.
In his first official to the country, Mark Field also held talks with Foreign Minister Mohamed Asim and Speaker Abdul Maseeh Mohamed as well as the leaders of political parties. He was accompanied by British ambassador James Dauris.
Alice Wells, United States assistant secretary of state, is meanwhile due to visit Malé to meet the president-elect.
“She will offer congratulations on the country’s successful national elections and convey U.S. interest in expanding bilateral cooperation,” according to the State Department.
On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Solih to congratulate him on the election victory.
“The Secretary congratulated the Maldivian people for coming out to vote in overwhelming numbers despite challenges. The Secretary noted that the election reflected the will of the Maldivian people, which all parties in the country should respect.

54,['Norton Norton'],2018-05-16 00:00:00,,"President Abdulla Yameen has extended the term of a commission formed to recover stolen assets until November 2018.
The commission was formed for a one-year period in July last year to oversee the recovery of funds flagged as stolen by the Auditor General and the anti-corruption watchdog.
Home Minister Azleen Ahmed, chair of the five-member commission, told the press Tuesday that the state was owed MVR29.7 billion (US$1.9 billion) from various parties, up from the previously floated figure of MVR13 billion.
The amount eclipses the entire state budget for 2018.
The commission has concluded cases worth MVR3.8 billion so far, Azleen added, some of which have been forwarded to the Attorney General and Prosecutor General’s offices.
“Some money has been recovered through the commission’s efforts and some money is at the repayment stage,” he claimed, without disclosing details.
Azleen dismissed criticism that the commission targets the president’s political opponents. The recovered funds could be used for development projects, he said, accusing previous administrations of failing to take action.
The cases before the commission include failed state-owned enterprises Fisheries Projects Implementation Division (FPID) and Air Maldives Limited under former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s 30-year administration.
The FPID corruption scandal 27 years ago led to the dissolution of the subsidiary of the State Trading Organisation and the formation of Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company.
Air Maldives, the first national carrier of the country, declared bankruptcy in 2000 after incurring losses estimated at US$50-70 million, amid allegations of mismanagement and corruption.
The commission is also trying to recover nearly US$80 million stolen from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation under the current administration’s watch.
The embezzlement of resort lease payments and other funds from the state-owned MMPRC was the biggest corruption scandal in Maldivian history.
Asked if the commission was looking into corruption cases in the present government, Azleen said: “Corruption belonging to this government hasn’t come to us. There isn’t any corruption that belongs to any government. It’s the people who carry out the corruption that it belongs to, isn’t that so?”

At the press conference, Minister Azleen highlighted that the commission has discovered around 29.7 billion Rufiyaa missing from State funds. He also noted the high priority accorded by President Yameen to recovering lost State assets.

The five-member commission was established in June last year for a period of one year. However, the chair of the commission and home minister Azleen Ahmed told reporters on Tuesday, that the president has now extended its term until November this year.
“Today president Yameen has decided to extend the commission’s term until November. Because a lot of our work is at a halfway point,” Azleen told reporters during a press conference.
The minister reiterated that the commission had uncovered billions of rufiyaa owed to the state adding that the figure stands at MVR29.7 billion so far.
Azleen revealed that the commission had completed its investigation into cases amounting to MVR3.8 billion while the remaining cases totalling MVR25.8 billion were still under investigation.
He warned that despite the huge sums owed to the state, the recovery of state assets was down to the courts.
The government had said the main purpose of establishing the commission was to analyse efforts taken by the institutions to recover State assets highlighted in reports published by the Auditor General and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).
The five-member commission is required to submit a progress report to the president every three months.
The Maldives has been ravaged by corruption and embezzlement of millions in state funds with top government officials and institutions, both former and current implicated in various audit and graft reports.

59,['Norton Norton'],2017-10-10 00:00:00,,"The original Dhivehi article was published on Avas.mv website on 8th October 2017.
The following is a loose translation:
The period was when government corruption talk is widely discussed around. When former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb was again discussed. When Jumhooree Party Leader Qasim Ibrahim publicly severely criticised the government. During that time, President Abdulla Yameen immediately formed a presidential commission, as per presidential decree from the constitution. In order to expedite the process of recovering the stolen state assets, the Commission on State Assets Recovery was conceived.
The commission comprised of 5 members was formed to fast track and come up with big results; to collect back the pilfered money as mentioned earlier by the Auditor General’s Office (AGO) and Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC). To take actions to speed up the process of recovering the missing money. The commission was also granted specific powers. The commission has the power to obtain related paperwork of cases they are probing and send necessary notice. While the commission also has the power to summon people and question them, they also have the authority to check the statuses of criminal cases with other related governmental institutions like the Maldives Police Service and Prosecutor General’s Office.
‘When there are millions of money owing to the government, the commission is working hard towards recovering it. And bring solutions to the issues faced by the government institutions in recovering them. We will try our level best to work towards that,’ said Attorney General Mohamed Anil on the day the commission was established.
The commission was formed on 20th July, and it is now 3 months since the establishment. Those 3 months were very special for the commission, and the most toughest times too. The commission was set up for a 1 year period and it was given 1 year term to produce results. However, the questions is – will they be able to deliver those anticipated big result? Or is the presidential commission even doing any work?
To date, none of commission’s work had been shared with the media. The commission’s Chair, Home Minister Azleen Ahmed said the commission’s work will be revealed after a meeting is held and after deliberations with all members. If an action was taken against an individual or a company, that information would have been already revealed. It is unknown whether the commission had sent any notices too. What is clear is that the recovery process of the embezzled money is delayed, is stuck, and the purpose of the commission is not fulfilled.
Which prompts the question – what is the real intention of forming the commission? Soon after forming the commission, President Yameen stood behind a podium and made verbal attacks at JP Leader and prominent businessman Qasim Ibrahim. He said there was no purpose to stand behind podiums delivering ‘good news’ to citizens without paying what he owes to the government. At that time Qasim was the strongest opposition leader who was ‘safe’.
On that day, President Yameen said that to recover the stolen state assets was one of the biggest priorities of the government. His next swipe was at ex-VP Ahmed Adeeb. He said Adeeb can leave the country for medical treatment only after reimbursing the money he owes to the state. During those days, president was always talking about money. He even said that the money Adeeb handled had been inside his own residence. Based on his such talks and the timing of commission’s establishment, the opposition claimed that the commission was a noose to wring around the necks of his political opponents.
The former supporter of the current regime Mohamed Ameeth said a commission in the name of an State Asset Recovery Commission was formed to go after Qasim. He said it is likely that it was formed to confiscate Qasim’s personal assets to the state. As from the audit report it is crystal clear who had abused and who are continuing to abuse public funds, but the government is not chasing them.
‘By undeservingly accusing prominent figures who oppose with the government’s political views, inventing cases against them, sending them to court, and trying to sentence them unlawfully, are the works done by the government by forming that commission,’ said Ameeth.
Ameeth said by setting up an Asset Recovery Commission to recover stolen assets, the first direction to look would be at government seniors. He claimed that the president is also amongst them. He also highlighted that the corruptions of ministers and managing directors in state-owned companies, can be seen in the audit report. He also said that he believes that without first investigating into their cases, their will not be anyone else’s case to look into.
When the presidential commission was formed, and before the commission had a chance to recover back any of the stolen money, an audit report has revealed many more funds have been stolen through corruption. It was the jaw-dropping corruption scandal at Fenaka Corporation. The state-owned company which supplies power to islands, allowed corruptive methods in purchasing the fuel, supply of power generators and other transactions, that resulted in millions of Rufiyaa in losses to Fenaka.
‘Their (government) words and actions never ever matched, especially of the president’s. He said his government will investigate corruption and take action. He admits that huge corruption scandals had happened during his term. Yet, we don’t see any investigations. When heads of the independent institutions were gifted with apartments with lowered price, even though they will pay for it, there were no one to oversee it. The audit report didn’t investigate any cases within the ministries. After making that ‘huge’ commission, no work by them is visible. That was just a ploy to threaten the opposition,’ said Ameeth.
Before President Yameen took office, making a presidential commission to investigate matters of the past was ridiculed by the president himself. He even described the move by President Mohamed Nasheed to make a presidential commission to investigate cases which happened during President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s office, was just to harass him.
When things were like that, by making a similar commission, something President Yameen is not too fond of, would he able to achieve results? The real intention behind the commission’s establishment is very questionable. While some were applauding when president said corruption will be stopped and actions will be taken, the citizens are subjected to shock after shock; with revelations of huge corruption scandals that keeps surfacing. There is no action taken against anyone except Adeeb. To this government corruption stops at Adeeb. Or they say that in previous government’s corruption had taken place too and downplay it as normal thing.
After the big scandal of MMPRC, and when Fenaka Corporation’s scandal also emerged, it is evident that, even though, the government says it is their top priority to stop corruption, it is in fact not the case. And the fact that, Mohamed Nimal, who was the Managing Director of Fenaka when the corruption took place still remains a close aid, is reason to believe that corruption investigation is only carried out against those who fallout. When things are like this, there is nothing further to be said about State Asset Recovery Commission’s purpose.","Maldives Asset Recovery Commission: a fake, a trap?",https://maldivestimes.com/maldives-asset-recovery-commission-a-fake-a-trap/
