The Maldivians – identified as Shifan Ibrahim, 30, Azim Habeeb, 33, and Mohamed Safoof, 34 – were arrested with Anthony Sami, 30, a Tamil Nadu native, from a hotel parking ground before they were about to leave for the airport.
Hidden in shampoo bottles, the drug haul was worth about US$246,500. Hashish oil is a thick liquid extracted from cannabis.
“The accused planned to smuggle the contraband brought from Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu to the Maldives via the Nedumbassery airport,” J Himendranath, deputy commissioner of the Kochi City police, was quoted as saying.
Their passports showed multiple trips between the Maldives, Thailand, Singapore and India in December alone, he said.
According to Kochi police, the suspects are part of a drug smuggling network from Hong Kong called Kona Gold, which uses Indian ports for their operations.
They were all on the wanted list of the Narcotics Control Bureau.
Last month, three Hongkongers were arrested while trying to smuggle 7kg of cocaine from the Maldives to the city. They were hired by a drug trafficking syndicate and promised a free tour of the Maldives in return, the South China Morning Post reported, citing Hong Kong police.
According to the new interim Maldives police chief, 130kg of drugs were seized in the country during the past three years.
“The drug epidemic is detrimental to our communities. Police use of certain tactics to prevent and deter drug trafficking and peddling is about achieving the overarching policing objective of protecting the public,” he tweeted Tuesday.

“I am pleased to announce that we’ve committed US$ 10 million to Maldives – US$7 million in foreign military financing to support Maldives maritime security and control its territorial waters and US$3 million to support civil society and help protect Maldives environment,” said David J. Ranz, the deputy assistant secretary of the central and south Asian affairs.
Ranz met reporters during an official visit to the Maldives with a delegation including senior officials from the Department of Justice, US AID, and the State Department’s bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement..
The Maldives is a critical partner in President Donal Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy, he said, adding the US delegation has held discussions to “expand the partnership”
“The election of President Solih and subsequent peaceful transfer of power was a major democratic movement and one that we view as profoundly significant for the whole region,” he continued. “The goal of our trip has been examining ways that we can expand our partnership with the Maldives in pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific, including how to be supportive during this critical period of transition.”
Discussions with the Maldives government focused on objectives and challenges and how the US could support strengthening democracy, improving governance, enhancing security and promoting development, Ranz said.
The delegation also discussed providing capacity building and training for Maldivian investigative authorities to help carry out probes into public financing management, asset recovery, and debt management.
But the US would not actively participate in any domestic investigations unless the Maldivian government sought consultancy, Ranz stressed.
“One of the goals of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to ensure that countries receive investments that is economically viable, that ensure sovereignty and and ensure they’re able to make decisions that are in best interests if the country and their people,” he said.
“We’ve seen in the region examples where countries have promoted investment that wasn’t designed to be a benefit to the people and wasn’t designed economically or commercially viable,” he said, referring to Chinese financing of the previous administration’s infrastructure projects.
“That has not been positive for those countries or the region. Many countries have begun to push back, the Maldives is one of those countries that I think has begun to push back with the new government. So one clear area is ensuring that the investment you receive is going to be a benefit to the Maldivian people and contribute to your economic growth and prosperity.”
The US would also help the Maldives develop its ability to patrol territorial waters under the security initiative.
This would include helping to develop the island nation’s ability to to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters, Ranz added, noting that heavy rainfall flooded the capital Malé just last week.
The US would also facilitate private sector investments through the new development finance corporation created by the recently enacted US Global BUILD Act, he said.",US pledges US$10 million in aid for the Maldives,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/us-pledges-us10-million-in-aid-for-the-maldives-143148

A 30-year-old man who was serving 25-years for a drug conviction died at the high-security prison Friday night. Local media identified him as Ali Abdulla from the Galolhu Fehimaa house in the capital Malé.
Ahmed Lugman, spokesman for the Maldives Correctional Service, confirmed the death but refused to disclose the cause.
He declined to respond to allegations of negligence circulating on social media. A family member told VFP that he was suffering from high blood pressure and a congenital heart problem.
Ali had called his mother on Thursday and asked for help in seeking a doctor’s consultation due to cramps. The family blames the MCS for failing to arrange medical care.
“A patient with blood pressure has been ill for many days and so many requests were made to see a doctor. He even called his mother [Thursday] and asked to see why he is not allowed to see a doctor. He apparently collapsed late last night [Friday] at 02:15 am. The family was informed at 04:30 am,” a former policewoman alleged.
MP Ahmed Mahloof, spokesman of the opposition coalition, said the Maldives now has the highest per capita rate of custodial deaths in the world with 13 in the past two years.
“Yet in a few days Criminal Court will be sentencing me to jail regarding a tweet about medical negligence in jails. I repeat those accusations again, as it’s more evident now,” he tweeted.
Mahloof was charged with false reporting to law enforcement over a tweet alleging culpability by the prisons authority. He served a sentence of nearly five months at the Maafushi prison last year.
On Saturday, the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party told the press that a shadow committee is preparing a research paper on recent custodial deaths.
The findings will inform prison policies in the party’s 2018 election manifesto, Malé City deputy mayor Shamau Shareef told reporters, urging the authorities to take medical complaints from inmates seriously.
“Another custodial death. Ali had called his mother yesterday complaining he’s being denied medical attention,” opposition MP Eva Abdulla alleged in a tweet.
“He died last night; report says ‘sudden death.’ No answers for all other custodial deaths over the last three years. No one held accountable, Human Rights Commission of the Maldives playing cover-up for the Govt.”
One social media user observed it was “just another day in Maldives, yet another death in custody and the tides bring in narcotics” whilst another tweet demanded “to know the names of all the inmates who died in custody in the last two years”.
Last month, the Human Rights Commission denied media reports of seeking charges over the custodial death of a Maafushi jail inmate whose family alleged he was denied treatment.

According to local media, a large amount of drugs was found on the boat. Well-packed cans and containers, as well as debris from the boat, later washed ashore on the beach of the nearby Uligamu island.
Two large packets were found on the beach of Molhadhoo island in Haa Alif atoll around 7 am Saturday morning.
Police have also been searching uninhabited islands in the region.
The Maldives National Defence Force was alerted to the foreign vessel on Thursday morning by fishermen from the northern atoll.
In March 2014, some 24kg of heroin was smuggled in a vessel registered in Iran.
Two Maldivian men were found guilty over the smuggling and sentenced to life imprisonment in April last year. They were the only ones to stand trial of the 18 suspects taken into custody, including 11 Pakistanis, four Maldivians, and three Bangladeshis.
The Pakistanis were later deported and the other suspects were released due to lack of evidence.
The country’s biggest drug haul came in 2006 when 1.6 tonnes of cannabis was found submerged in the lagoon of an island in Alif Alif atoll.
No arrests were made and police destroyed the stash two years later.

“Lack of higher educational opportunities, high youth unemployment, rise of social media, and weak institutions all contribute to an environment in which Islamist violent extremism is on the rise,” Wells said at the hearing on the State Department’s 2018 South Asia budget.
“Our work with the government to combat violent extremism remains critically important, in a country with a grim distinction: per capita, it has produced more terrorists who have fought in Iraq and Syria than any other country in the world.”
The State Department’s request for US$440,000 in foreign assistance for the Maldives is to continue “limited support for maritime security cooperation,” she added, noting “threats posed by narcotics trafficking, piracy in the Indian Ocean, and seaborne trade in illicit materials of potential use for terrorist activity.”
The Maldives abuts sea lanes through which pass two-thirds of the world’s oil and half of its container shipments, she observed.
The US concern comes amidst renewed political turmoil after the opposition coalition secured the parliament’s majority with defections from the divided ruling party in early July. Seven former ruling party lawmakers have since been contentiously unseated, a dozen opposition lawmakers put on trial, and Jumhooree Party leader Gasim Ibrahim sentenced in absentia to more than three years in prison.
The military was also deployed to lock down the parliament and protect the embattled speaker whilst former President Maumoon Gayoom’s son, MP Faris Maumoon, who led a bloc of lawmakers loyal to his father, has been detained for nearly two months.
With Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed conducting the Majlis under military guard and heated exchanges descending into brawls, US Ambassador Atul Keshap had called the events “disturbing and unfortunate” in late August.

Husham downplayed the discovery and suggested that the prohibited item was not necessarily a mobile phone as reported by local media.
“We would consider an extra pillow as contraband as well. An item might be allowed inside the jail but it could not be permitted inside the cell. Prison guards search the cells every day and remove a lot of items which are not allowed inside a cell,” he said.
‘Asseyri’ is a low-security jail, but the high-profile inmates are held at a special unit located away from other cell blocks. The former defence ministers, ruling party MP, and the religious conservative party leader were all jailed amidst a political crisis triggered in February this year.
The contraband discovery was widely reported by local media last night. The news followed revelations that a blast on the president’s speedboat last week was an assassination attempt and fuelled speculation on social media.

14,[],2015-08-11,,"President Abdulla Yameen has exercised authority granted by the Clemency Act to pardon a convict sentenced to 10 years in prison on drug trafficking charges.
Ismail Shaheem, from Thaa Thimarafushi Karankavilla, was arrested in June 2011 along with alleged drug kingpin Ibrahim Shafaz ‘Shafa’ with more than 800 grams of drugs following a two-year long operation.
Shaheem was greeted at the gate of Maafushi jail yesterday by ruling Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM) MP Ibrahim Shujau, and Shafaz, who posted a picture on Facebook.
“Dont say we CAN’T.. HE IS OUT…,” Shafaz wrote.
The police claimed Shafaz’s network had smuggled drugs worth MVR1.3 million (US$84,306) to the Maldives between February and April 2011.
The suspects were arrested from a rented apartment in a building owned by PPM MP Ahmed ‘Redwave’ Saleem. MP Shujau is the manager at Saleem’s supermarket chain Redwave
The criminal court found Shaheem guilty of possessing narcotic prescription drugs for sale in November 2013. He was, however, cleared of trafficking narcotics, which carries a higher sentence.
The High Court upheld the verdict earlier this year.
Shafaz was also found guilty of drug trafficking in November 2013 and sentenced to 18 years in jail, but the High Court overturned the conviction in January 2015.
Two months after he was jailed, Shafaz was temporarily released for medical treatment in Sri Lanka in February 2014, but failed to return to the Maldives after an approved period of three months. The Sri Lankan police caught Shafaz in Colombo and extradited him to Maldives in May 2014.
Shaheem had meanwhile been arrested in 2008 during a security operation by the military to curb gang violence in Malé. He was accused of stabbing a watchman at the ADK hospital and fleeing the scene.
A spokesperson for the Maldives Correctional Service confirmed to The Maldives Independent that Shaheem was pardoned along with four others yesterday in accordance with the clemency law.
The clemency law states that the president can pardon convicts if they have served one-fourth of their sentence, and have exhausted all appeal processes or have no further avenue to file an appeal.
The law previously stated convicts must serve one-third of their sentences, but the period was amended to one-fourth in December 2014 by the PPM.
Shaheem was jailed in November 2013 and has served one year eight months in prison. To be eligible for a pardon, he would have to have served 2.5 years. The government may have counted the time spent under pre-trial detention in issuing the pardon, but The Maldives Independent was not able to clarify the facts at the time of going to press.
Shaheem is known as Ippa Ismael on Facebook. His profile appears to show he had access to the internet in jail. On July 22, he wrote: “Congra our new VP Ahmed Adeeb. Zuvaanunge bro [youth’s bro].”
The four others pardoned by Yameen include Hassan Shifau and Mohamed Hameed, who were jailed for seven years after being found guilty of vandalising the VTV office in Malé during an opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) protest in March 2012.
The president also pardoned two other convicts, Hussain Didi and Ilyas Fuad, who were serving six-year prison terms on charges of theft and drug abuse, respectively.

15,[],2015-08-19,,"The High Court on Tuesday overturned a man’s life sentence on drug trafficking charges on the grounds that the accused was not allowed to respond to the prosecution’s evidence.
In its ruling, the appellate court said Ramiz Ahmed, from Janavareemaage in Laamu Isdhoo, was “deprived of the fundamental constitutional right” to examine the evidence or testimony against him.
The criminal court reached a guilty verdict based on a police report that stated the defendant’s fingerprints were found an envelop containing illicit narcotics. However, Ramiz was neither informed of the report nor offered an opportunity to respond to its contents.
Ramiz was arrested along with another man on September 5, 2010 from a residence in Malé. The police found three rubber packets with 329 grams of heroin. The pair also tested positive for cannabis.
The High Court, however, noted that the prosecution’s witness testimony did not establish that Ramiz had rented the room where the drugs were discovered.
In March, the criminal court sentenced former President Mohamed Nasheed to 13 years in prison after a 19-day trial that was widely criticised over its apparent lack of due process.
The opposition leader’s lawyers had objected to insufficient time to prepare a defence whilst the three-judge panel had also refused to hear defence witnesses.
The prosecutor general has since appealed the terrorism conviction at the High Court.
In late July, the Supreme Court acquitted a convicted drug trafficker citing irregularities similar to that raised by Nasheed’s lawyers.

16,[],2019-03-12,,"President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih opened Monday morning a Centre for Mental Health at the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Malé.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, President Solih noted the “long wait-list” of people who seek appointments, the social stigma surrounding mental illnesses, and the struggle of Maldivians who suffer from mental illnesses to seek treatment due to the acute shortage of qualified professionals.
The main aim of the first national centre for mental health in the Maldives is to “provide treatment compassionately to mental health patients through a holistic system and at national level,” he said.
With a multi-disciplinary team, the centre offers emergency care as well as outpatient and inpatient services including diagnostics, treatment, rehabilitation and occupational therapy, according to IGMH.
The centre will also conduct outreach programmes in the atolls and seek to raise awareness among the public to change attitudes towards mental health problems.
One in four Maldivians have suffered from a mental illness at some point in their lives, Dr Shanooha Mansoor noted in her remarks. According to Health Minister Abdulla Ameen, more than 2,500 people sought treatment at IGMH for mental illnesses during the past six months.
Establishing a national institute to treat mental illnesses was a target of the new administration’s 100-day action plan. It was a key campaign pledge of President Solih along with expanding the state’s Aasandha health insurance scheme to provide comprehensive coverage and making counselling services more widely available with regional psychiatric centres.
Services at the new centre will be free and covered by Aasandha.
Before the centre was opened, there were only two consultation rooms for psychiatrists at IGMH. Only four patients at a time could be hospitalised at the psychiatric ward.
Private clinics charge about MVR500 (US$32) for therapy sessions and up to MVR3,000 for psychiatric assessments, relatively high prices that dissuade most people from seeking treatment.
In his remarks, the president acknowledged that the new centre would not completely solve the difficulties faced by people suffering from mental health problems.
“But I believe this is a good start and that they will have some relief to the hardship they endure,” he said.
The government will work towards training qualified doctors and professionals to expand mental health services, he added, noting that opportunities to specialise in mental health were offered in the student loan scheme announced last week.

The center was renovated and reopened after three years, according to state media. When it was shut down in 2016, the only services being offered were community service programmes for heroin addicts.
The Hithadhoo Drug Detoxification and Community Rehabilitation Centre now offers detoxification services and treatment after admission.
During his campaign trip over the weekend, President Solih pledged to build the country’s largest drug rehabilitation centre in the southernmost atoll.
Drug addiction is one of the most pressing social problems facing the country, he said.
The centre would be part of an MVR 5.3 billion project aimed at “repopulating” the second city with tourist beds, roads, housing and an international airport, he said.
According to a 2012 UN report, there are 7,496 heroin addicts in the Maldives. However, critics say the real figure is likely to be much higher.

18,[],2019-03-10,,"President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih returned to the campaign trail on Saturday to stump for Maldivian Democratic Party candidates ahead of the April 6 parliamentary elections.
At four campaign events for the MDP’s candidates in Addu City, Solih urged voters to elect lawmakers who would support the party’s legislative agenda, which he stressed was necessary to deliver manifesto pledges.
“[During the presidential campaign] we talked about recovering money stolen from state coffers, finding out and revealing what happened to people who were murdered and disappeared. We also talked about reforming the judiciary,” he said on Meedhoo.
“We talked about the need to make the People’s Majlis a place with integrity. At the point we have reached today, we need to bring changes to the People’s Majlis. It has become difficult to do these things without the full support of the People’s Majlis,” he said, referring to the “sabotage” of government-sponsored legislation on empowering inquiry commissions despite the ruling coalition’s majority.
Solih acknowledged the backing of coalition partners in securing his decisive victory against former president Abdulla Yameen in September’s election.
None of the partners would “face any harm or misfortune from the work we’re doing,” he assured.
The four coalition parties are standing alone for the April 6 polls after the MDP decided to field candidates in all 87 constituencies. Accusing the MDP on reneging on an agreement on dividing seats, the Jumhooree Party has backed 32 opposition candidates in exchange for the endorsement of 27 JP candidates.
Speaking on the Hithadhoo island, Solih noted the lack of a parliamentary majority during the previous MDP government.
“Go on and give the People’s Majlis majority to us this time. We will show the difference,” he appealed, adding that an MDP majority would “exponentially” speed up the fulfilment of pledges.
Accompanied by former president Mohamed Nasheed – himself a candidate for a newly-formed constituency in the capital Malé – Solih travelled to Addu City on Friday and attended a rally to launch the campaign of the MDP’s seven candidates.
At the Maradhoo rally, the president announced an MVR5.3 billion (US$343 million) five-year project for the southernmost atoll. The project to “repopulate” the second city includes adding 8,000 tourist beds, constructing roads, reclaiming land, providing social housing, developing an international airport, and building a fish harbour and processing factory.
Other components include a sports complex, swimming pool, football stadium, an Islamic centre, and the country’s largest drug rehabilitation centre.
He reiterated pledges to devolve more powers and financial autonomy to island and city councils.
– Coup –
Solih’s speeches on Saturday were followed by warnings of a coup from former president Nasheed.
The executive would be “weakened” and vulnerable without a parliament majority, he contended.
Nasheed – who resigned as president in the wake of a violent mutiny by rogue elements of the police and military – said efforts to oust him began in parliament. Bribes were offered to six MDP lawmakers, he recalled.
He laid out the stages in the build-up to overthrowing a government. It begins with no-confidence votes against cabinet ministers, followed by obstruction and blocking of funds for projects.
As a consequence, judges and members of independent bodies become politicised, he continued, after which the police and military lose confidence in the government.
“When that happens, as you know there among us those who are practised in perpetrating coups even if I don’t name them, these people then start spending the dirty money of bribery on institutions,” he said.","On campaign trail, President Solih appeals for MDP majority",https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/on-campaign-trail-president-solih-appeals-for-mdp-majority-144115

The chancellor of the Islamic University of Maldives appealed to religious scholars to stay clear of politics. Shaheem criticised former colleagues and clerics in the Adhaalath Party for backing the opposition, alleging that the coalition’s goal was to establish a secular state. There was a plot afoot by adversaries of Islam to ruin local scholars, he claimed.

Mohamed Nabeeh, Adam Farhaan and Ahmed Afsal are accused of leaving the country on 2 July 2017 to join the war in Syria.
The trio, who are from Noonu Atoll Maradhoo, are being tried under article 16(2) of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
If found guilty they face a jail sentence of 17 to 20 years.
They are being represented by Ismail Mohamed, who successfully defended three other men on the same charge in 2016. They were acquitted and set free by the Criminal Court in October.
He asked the judge to release the three defendants after the charges were read out at Monday’s preliminary hearing.
The three have been in detention for eight months and are “very sick,” Ismail said.
“A nerve in Nabeeh’s brain has been damaged and one side of his body is numb. Farhaan has pain in a nerve in his backbone. Afzal is suffering from headaches, his migraines are starting to affect his eyesight.”
Ismail asked the judge to consider their criminal record and the court’s release of defendants in prior cases.
Nabeeh and Farhaan do not have a criminal record while Afsal, in his youth, completed a drug rehabilitation program, Ismail said.
Hassan Faizaan was on trial for the same charge and was released by the Criminal Court on 17 April 2017, Ismail said.
State attorneys asked for medical documents to prove the health concerns.
The judge must verify if the condition of the suspects warranted release since they are facing serious charges with lengthy jail terms, the state attorney said.
Ismail agreed to provide available medical documents but Maldives Correctional Services have yet to provide him with some information, he added.
The Criminal Court has previously released suspects facing serious charges such as child abuse, drug trafficking and, in the case of Adhaalath Party leader Sheikh Imran, terrorism, the court heard.
“So, I urge the honourable judge to consider to make a decision to ease their detention, especially since this is the month of Ramadan and my clients have been both physically and mentally affected.”
There was no problem if the judge decided to hold their passports, Ismail said in court.
Ismail told the Maldives Independent after the hearing that he is currently handling three such cases.

23,[],2018-04-30,,"Religious extremist websites and jihadist propaganda remain online in the Maldives, months after the government said it would block them.
Defence Minister Adam Shareef told reporters in January that online extremist content would be blocked, shortly after the United States issued a travel advisory citing the threat of a terror attack in the Maldives.
The US-based security and risk management consultancy the Soufan Group has said around 200 to 250 Maldivians are known to be fighting in Syria and Iraq, making the island nation the highest foreign fighter contributor based on per capita.
But the government has refuted the figures, offering various lower estimates and decrying damage to the economy due to “exaggerated” claims.
“We have been noticing some information on websites and open sources that lead to people becoming more radicalised,” Shareef said earlier this year at a news conference. “We are continually working with the Communication Authority to block these websites, because we see this as necessary to do for the good of the Maldivian people.”
The Maldives Independent has found that several websites — including those known to be linked to Maldivians fighting in the Syrian war — are still accessible.
— ‘We won’t stop this jihad’ —
One website was not accessible from the Maldives, but a Telegram channel with 208 subscribers gave instructions on how to access it using proxy servers and VPNs.
The website has a dedicated page for jihadist propaganda, with stories detailing murders of Jews, the last letter sent by a fighter to his wife and a six-part series titled “Get Consumed in Your Anger, We Won’t Stop this Jihad.”
All the website content is in Dhivehi and the Telegram channel for the website has been sharing articles since April 2017.
Another website spreading radical propaganda has a monthly magazine with 32 issues released so far.
It has profiles of Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi. It also includes content designed to radicalize young people.
This website’s Telegram channel, created in August 2016, has more than 600 subscribers. Content is shared on the channel daily covering the lives of Maldivian fighters who have been killed in Syria’s conflict and several books in Dhivehi about jihad.
Some of these books cover topics such as the differences between “assaultive jihad and defensive jihad,” guerilla warfare, why people converted to Islam after 9/11, the “fruits” of jihad and the purpose of jihad.
One book explains the different places people can go to for jihad including Afghanistan, Chechnya, Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, Iraq and the Arabian peninsula.
Another explains the ways to decide whether someone is a Muslim or not and how to deal with foreign Islamist organizations.
Another justifies suicide as a means of warfare and invites fighters to take part in suicide attacks. Dhivehi translations of speeches or text written by al-Awlaki, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are also shared.
The books are usually uploaded to online file hosting websites from where they can easily be downloaded in PDF format.
The Telegram channel boasts that the website is available in mobile and desktop versions and that all the books can be downloaded through the website.
Two other Telegram channels, one created in November 2015 with more than 400 subscribers and another created in August 2016 with more than 600 subscribers, are also used to share content from at least three websites, a YouTube channel associated with one of the websites and links for books and magazines.
Most of these websites also have a presence on Twitter and Facebook.
— Foreign fighters –
Staff at the National Counter Terrorism Center told the Maldives Independent that the centre’s director, Brigadier General Zakariyya Mansoor, was busy with meetings and was unavailable for immediate comment.
“In my view the NCTC is either hiding everything or not doing anything,” said Shahindha Ismail, the executive director of the Maldivian Democracy Network. “There has only been an increase in violent extremist propaganda, violent attacks on individuals who criticise extremism and no sign of a rehabilitation program being implemented. The Center needs to pull its act together.”
The NCTC needed to work with civil society organisations because they had been working on issues around radicalisation and extremism for longer and so had more information and knowledge about it, she added.
The NCTC, established in 2016 to combat extremism and radicalisation, launched its website and hotline in April 2017.
But the hotline number given on the website – 1516 – has been unreachable since the launch. When queried by the Maldives Independent in January, an NCTC staff member admitted the number was incorrect. The correct number for the hotline is 1615.

According to the police, the three men were arrested in a joint operation with the Turkish law enforcement authorities. They were alleged to have been planning to cross the border into Syria to join a militant group.
The police declined to reveal their identities or any further information.
The criminal court in Malé remanded the suspects to police custody for 15 days upon their arrival in the Maldives.
In late August, the criminal court concluded the trial of the first suspects prosecuted for travelling abroad with the intent of joining a terror group after it was criminalised by the 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act.
The three Maldivian men were charged with terrorism following their arrest from the Turkey-Syria border in February 2016. A Maldivian man who attempted to cross into Syria was also arrested and repatriated in February this year. Two others who allegedly fought with militant groups in Pakistan are also standing trial.
More recently, two Maldivian men with links to the Islamic State terror group were arrested in Malaysia. They were accused of “using Malaysia and Singapore as a transit point before heading to Syria to join IS.”
According to local media, the two men were freed after they were brought back to the Maldives.
The anti-terror law was passed after the current administration was accused of ignoring the threat posed by jihadi recruitment since the first reports of Maldivians joining terror groups emerged in 2014.
The opposition claims as many as 250 Maldivians are fighting in Syria and Iraq – the highest per capita in the region. But the government says the opposition has been inflating the figure to lobby international support for its cause, offering various lower estimates and decrying damage to the economy due to “exaggerated” claims.
Defence Minister Adam Shareef Umar insisted in late April that the number of Maldivians fighting in Syria is 49.

The two Maldivians, aged 29 and 33, were arrested in Johor Bahu along with a Malaysian on August 7 and 9, Malaysian media reported Tuesday.
“The two Maldives men, who worked as air-conditioner technicians, were arrested for using Malaysia and Singapore as a transit point before heading to Syria to join IS,” Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Mohamad Fuzi Harun was quoted as saying in a statement.
“The 40-year-old Malaysian trader was arrested for being in possession of six issues of Dabiq, the official IS newsletter, and a few IS-related articles on his mobile phone.”
According to The Star, the 19 suspects included eight members of the Abu Sayyaf militant group – six Malaysians and two Philipinnos – whose “mastermind” was suspected of having planned attacks in Kuala Lumpur during the closing of the Southeast Asian Games and Malaysia’s National Day celebrations.
The other suspects included a Palestinian planning to join an IS cell in the southern Philippines, a Bangladeshi suspected of belonging to an IS-affiliated group in Bangladesh, two Indonesian men accused of recruiting fighters for IS, and three Iraqis linked to IS cells in Iraq and an IS-friendly group in Albania.
The spokesman of the Maldives Police Service said information about the case could not be shared with the media at present.
Last May, a man was arrested for hoisting the black flag of IS at the artificial beach in Malé.
In late August, the criminal court concluded the trial of the first suspects prosecuted for travelling abroad with the intent of joining a terror group after it was criminalised by the 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act.
The three Maldivian men were charged with terrorism following their arrest from the Turkey-Syria border in February 2016. More recently, a Maldivian man who attempted to cross into Syria to join the civil war was arrested and repatriated in February this year. Two others who allegedly fought with militant groups in Pakistan are also standing trial.
The anti-terror law was passed after the current administration was accused of ignoring the threat posed by jihadi recruitment since the first reports of Maldivians joining terror groups emerged in 2014.
The opposition claims as many as 250 Maldivians are fighting in Syria and Iraq – the highest per capita in the region. But the government says the opposition has been inflating the figure to lobby international support for its cause, offering various lower estimates and decrying damage to the economy due to “exaggerated” claims.

26,[],2017-08-15,,"The criminal court concluded Monday the trial of three Maldivian men charged with terrorism following their arrest from the Turkey-Syria border in February 2016.
Ahmed Latheef, Ahmed Suhail Moosa, and Munawwar Abdulla are the first suspects to stand trial for travelling abroad with the intent of joining a terror group after the offence was criminalised by the controversial 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act.
The court heard closing arguments from the prosecution and defence at Monday’s hearing.
The prosecution’s case was based on statements collected from the suspects by the police, testimony from 11 anonymous witnesses, an immigration report outlining travel details, plane tickets, audio analysis of calls, a telegram chat log, intelligence reports and expert opinions from officers who prepared the reports.
Citing audio analysis of conversations, State Prosecutor Aishath Azleena told the court that one of the defendants told a witness that he was in the “sacred land of Shām to seek Jannat-ul Firdaus”.
Munawwar Abdulla was also alleged to have said that he was in Syria for “a sacred purpose” and to do “the most blessed work a man can do on earth.”
Munawar was alleged to have asked the witness to tell his mother to remain on the “path of tawheed”, to pray for him, and to watch sermons by particular sheikhs. He also asked the witness to assure his mother that if he died in “jihad”, his whole family would go to heaven.
The prosecutor also cited a similar conversation between Latheef and one of the witnesses, which she said was sufficient to establish that the accused were religious extremists.
The three defendants, however, maintained their innocence and insisted that they travelled to Turkey on a “business trip” to meet several potential partners.
They were stopped at a checkpoint and arrested by the Turkish Security Forces, they said.
According to Raajje TV, the three men were arrested while trying to cross a mud ditch dug between border fences as a buffer to prevent illegal crossings.
They left the Maldives for Sri Lanka on February 16 last year with two others and flew to Turkey after transiting in Dubai.
According to the police witnesses, the five Maldivians divided into two groups upon arriving in Turkey and two of them crossed the border into Syria.
Munawwar was alleged to have been heading to a camp in Iraq. He told friends that he would not be reachable via phone for two months.
An anonymise expert told the court that recruits are taught Arabic and terrorist ideology and provided military training in these camps, which could take between one month to a year.
Phones are believed to be confiscated during the training.
The police expert witnesses said there are over 113 such camps in Iraq and Syria. Agents from terrorist organisations help foreign recruits get into Syria, they said.
The prosecutor also dismissed the defence lawyer’s claim that the three had return tickets. The tickets were purchased on March 10, she said, citing the police intelligence report.
The defence lawyer meanwhile reiterated that the onus was on the state to prove that his clients travelled with the intent of joining a militant group, stressing that the government has not publicised a list of designated terrorist organisations.
He also questioned the admissibility of the audio analysis report as state witnesses had denied providing the evidence, which he said implies that it was acquired without a court warrant or their consent.
Judge Adam Arif concluded the hearing after announcing that a verdict will be delivered on August 30.
If found guilty, the three men could be handed a jail term of between 10 and 20 years.
In February, a Maldivian man who attempted to cross into Syria to join the civil war was also arrested and repatriated. It is unclear if he has been charged with terrorism.
Two others who allegedly fought with militant groups in Pakistan are also standing trial.
The opposition claims as many as 250 Maldivians are fighting in Syria and Iraq – the highest per capita in the region.

27,[],2017-07-26,,"The following is an unofficial translation from the president’s office of President Abdulla Yameen’s Independence Day address to the nation.
It is with love and respect that I extend greetings and felicitations on the occasion of our Independence Day.
Independence Day celebrates the end of British Rule over Maldives. It marks the end of an era when we paid taxes for our “protection” and existence. As we celebrate our independence, I would like to observe a moment in remembrance of Summuwul Ameer Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefaanu, the champion who secured our independence, and all other heroes, who contributed in various ways through out our history, to ensure our independence. I pray to Allah to bless their souls and grant them Jannath. I also include those who strive every day to ensure our independence and protect our sovereignty in my prayers.
Beloved Maldivians,
Today, we have moved our national strive beyond our boundaries, into the international arena to compete with professionals and experts of international stature. Today the national debate should be about whether we as a nation, have what it takes to strive and win the international race. While Maldivian athletes have risen to compete in regional finals our students are contesting in the highest recognised global academic awards. This is the time for us to dedicate all our energy and resources to win in the race for excellence.
It is my mandate to prioritise our resources and organise our troops to optimise our national output and achieve our full potential as a people. It is my duty to eliminate disparities and minimise discord; existing and created with intent, within the people.
In the past four years, we have undertaken developmental work, unparalleled to any other developmental era. Initiatives which were badly needed yet side lined. Developmental goals that should have been attained. Had these goals been realised we would have achieved milestones in development and increased the standard of living for Maldivians.
Development projects such as,
Expansion of Velana International Airport to cater for modern day aircraft and the required services, to cater for its expectations as the symbol of Maldivian national pride.
Expansion of health services at IGMH, including the opening of the new 25 storey building, along with the new developments in Hithadhoo and Kulhudhuffushi Regional Hospitals enabling advanced services, which will bring an end to inconveniences faced by Maldivians who have to seek treatment abroad, away from families for major illnesses.
Development of Hulhumalé and the new housing development projects will enable blissful family lives.
The Malé-Hulhulé Bridge will bring an end to the era of logistical obstacles faced by Maldivians who live in separate islands.
30 new resorts that are expected to open by the end of next year will create 18,000 job opportunities.
Current projects underway to provide water and sewerage systems to 75 percent of the population, 33 completed ports and 39 ongoing ports projects, along with the current road development projects in 13 islands, will pave the way to solve most of the logistical obstacles faced by island residents in their everyday lives.
Each and every one of these projects is a milestone of its own, will create job opportunities and enhance the quality of life for the people.
Beloved Maldivians,
Peace and tranquillity are the Maldivian brand name. Maldives is “paradise on earth”. Maldivians are the icons for hospitality and friendly hospitability. The endless stretches of white sandy beaches are a safe haven, even for the most vulnerable of small birds.
Yet, today we are forced to acknowledge that this peace and harmony is facing the threat of extinction. We hear alarm bells, reminding us that the days of peace and tranquillity might be waving adieu to the beaches of the Maldives. Drums of anger and disruption are being beaten. The spotless white beaches without footsteps which we once roamed about are now tainted with acts of selfishness, self-interest and the blood of Maldivians wounded and murdered in crimes which were once alien to this nation.
The battle to keep influential colonial powers at bay now emerges with fuel from within the Maldives. Words of mockery, harassment and anger have replaced the laughter of the children, and the fond stories of the aged, once heard in our living rooms and Holhuashi [seafront seating and recreational areas of the island] in every island. Jealousy seems to have paved its way into the national arena. Undisguised, self-centred efforts to deter national development aimed to benefit people en masse are carried without hesitation.
Today we see politicians pursuing their own interests under the guise of citizens’ rights. Yet, the reality remains that supporting these politically motivated calls will neither pay our healthcare or electricity bills, nor will it help us obtain educational opportunities for our students who achieve academic excellence. We also need to recognise that time spent on answering these questions and combatting these efforts, divert time, energy and financial resources away from ports, hospitals, housing projects and other similar initiatives aimed towards the betterment of life.
Beloved Maldivians,
The Maldivian Constitution was drafted and crafted on a Presidential System. This was a decision made by Maldivians via a referendum held in 2007. The very basis of a Presidential System is that a person is directly elected by the people to serve as the Head of State and Government during a specified presidential term, upon a presented Manifesto. That one single person remains as the Head of State and Government responsible for the whole nation.
However, accountability mechanisms are also an inherent feature of the Presidential system, such that government officials will be held answerable and accountable, should they breach their duty to conserve the interests of the State and its citizens. Such mechanisms are established to ensure the smooth functioning of the State and delivery of services to the people.
Another significant feature of the presidential system is that the State and the Government will continue to function through the Head of State and Government, even without commanding the majority of the legislature.
Constitutional frameworks are designed in this manner to ensure that the interests of the State reign supreme. National security is not threatened and services provided to the people, continue without disruption. Disruption threatens the stability and security of the country, resulting in costly and unquantifiable loss of opportunities.
Beloved people,
Constitutional experts who have researched the Maldivian Constitutional and legal system, have opined that the system is designed for a deadlock. They have stated that it provides opportunities for the President to be presented to the public with one hand tied behind his back. The system is riddled with loopholes which allow enemies of the State to meddle in government and State affairs. The Maldivian Constitution has been found to be too complicated and costly for a country with such limited resources and manpower. The Constitutional framework, newly introduced in 2008 is too burdensome and complicated for a country, which cannot boast a lifestyle of democratic history. One of the basic tenets of democracy is for peoples’ affairs to be handled by elected public officials. The Maldives’ elections framework and that of its elected officials is the perfect example of the complexity of the Maldivian Constitutional frame work.
Nine years have passed since the ratification of the Constitution, during which seven national elections have been held. Based on the number of days allocated for elections in the legislation, almost 40 percent of that time has been spent on direct election activities. Every 466th person is a salaried public official elected at a National Election. Up until March 2017, the figure stood at 292.
If all the elected and salaried public officials are working in the best interests of the people, the question arises as to who benefits from safer streets and safer communities. Who would benefit when students are able to concentrate on their exams and the children and the elderly are able to sleep peacefully. Would the country as a whole not benefit if peace and stability prevailed? Should not the primary responsibility of the elected officials be to protect the interest of the people whom they are representing? Is their obligation not one of a trust?
Simultaneously, we should also pose the question of whether, elected public officials can abuse power granted by the Constitution and the laws, to halt the development projects and provision of services merely to further their own political motives and ambition? The question of whether this would be a legitimate use of their constitutional powers?
Beloved people,
As I have stated on many occasions, I took on the responsibility of governing this country to combat the challenges faced by our nation. Solving the age old problems, battled yet unsolved by previous administrations. Problems whose solutions will enable a better future for our children and their children.
Hence, my work to combat efforts to propagate religious beliefs other than Islam and to ensure that Maldives remains as a 100% Muslim nation; to prevent apostasy amongst the youth; to ensure safety of lives of the people and their property; to combat terrorism, radicalism and extremism; to fight against drug and related offences and to enhance the system of children and women’s protection; to repay the government debt and stabilise the weakened economy; to create more job opportunities for our youth.
These were, are and will remain as my battle and war for this beloved nation of ours.
These issues were not born in the past 4 years. In fact, they are problems inherited from previous administrations. Nonetheless, the fact remains, that efforts to obstruct and halt the untiring work of this Government and its employees, can never amount to serving the interest of the State or its people.
Beloved Maldivians,
Despite the constant challenges, betrayals and disruptions I face, in implementing the above Agenda, I have remained un-relented and steadfast because I believe in the potential of our country. Because I have hopes and dreams for this nation. Because I have a certain faith in our people.
My goals are to increase the income and sufficiency of Maldivians to ensure happiness and prosperity; rehabilitate and reintegrate victims of drug abuse and crime, back into the society and provide them with job opportunities and accept their place in families and the society; divert funds spent on correctional and rehabilitation facilities towards housing, health and wages; ensure that marginalised children with disabilities and learning difficulties are given an opportunity for a bright future; make Velana International Airport and IGMH regionally acclaimed establishments; train our sports players and athletes to become invincible; build our professionals to be the absolute best in their fields.
Although we are comparatively small in population, size and resources, I believe that we as a nation have the capability and commitment to achieve these goals and attain excellence.
Fellow Maldivians, it is you, who have entrusted me with this mandate. I urge you to join me in this venture and earn the honour of contributing towards the prosperity of Maldivians. Let us seize this opportunity to make the glimmer of hope shining in our children’s eyes a reality. Let us join hands without prejudice, to deliver the Maldivian dream.
Glory of your nation can only be built upon the glorification of your service to the nation.
We triumph as a nation and we fall as people.
It is Almighty Allah and him alone that I seek help in carrying out the trust the people tasked me with! May Allah preserve our independence and sovereignty for eternity. May my beloved people be blessed with happiness and prosperity.",Deadlock and development: Yameen’s Independence Day address,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/deadlock-and-development-yameens-independence-day-address-131707

The 13 men were the only candidates to stand for four island councils and one atoll council seat, the electoral body announced on Monday.
Hussain Hassan from the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party was elected unopposed to the northern Haa Dhaal atoll council from the Nolhivaram constituency.
Independent candidates Abdul Majeed Hussain, Ahmed Hussain, and Wafir Ahmed were elected to the island council of Kinolhas in Raa atoll. The northern island has a local population of 432 people, according to the 2014 census.
Hussain Yousuf and Abdul Raheem Mohamed from the ruling Progressive Party of Maldives along with independent candidate Gassan Abdulla were elected to the island council of Dhidhdhoo in Alif Alif atoll. The central island’s population is 137.
Naufal Hassan, Ali Rasheed, and Thowfeeq Ali from the PPM were elected to the island council of Guraidhoo in Thaa atoll. The ruling party stronghold in the south has a population of 1,211.
Independent candidates Hussain Haleel, Ali Riyaz, and Gasim Ibrahim were elected to the island council of Raiymandhoo in Meemu atoll. The south-central island’s population is 111.
All four islands have three-member councils.
Following multiple delays, the Maldives’ third local council election is due to take place on April 15.
On Tuesday, the elections commission announced that it has decided not to set up polling stations in the south Indian city of Trivandrum, 14 resorts, the Hulhulé airport island and the industrial islands of Thilafushi, Felivaru and Kooddoo as well as the drug treatment and rehabilitation centre on the island of Himmafushi because the minimum required numbers of voters failed to register.
Voters who wish to vote outside their constituency or native island were required to re-register ahead of a deadline of March 9.
Those who registered to vote at the cancelled boxes will be allowed to register to vote elsewhere by the end of the week. The only overseas polling station will be at the Maldives embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
After assigning ballot numbers on March 9, the elections commission has also published the list of candidates on the government gazette.
According to the commission, a total of 1,487 candidates applied to contest, including 1,124 candidates from political parties and 363 independents.
The number of city, atoll and island councillors was meanwhile reduced from more than 1,000 to 653 after the parliament revised the landmark 2010 Decentralisation Act to reduce the number of councillors from five to three for islands with a population of less than 3,000.
Only 13 islands will now have a five-member island council, down from a seven-member council at present.
The law was also changed to elect one atoll councillor for each parliamentary constituency in an atoll, down from two for each constituency. Three atoll councillors will be elected for atolls with two parliamentary constituencies.
According to the electoral body, 563 councillors will be elected to 179 island councils, 67 councillors to 18 atoll councils, and 23 councillors to three city councils.
The local council election was previously scheduled to take place on January 14, but was postponed after the PPM petitioned the civil court for a two-month delay citing the loss of its database and membership registry.
In the previous local council elections held in January 2014, the MDP won 457 seats (41.5 percent) and the PPM won 281 seats (25.5 percent).
The PPM’s coalition partners at the time, the Jumhooree Party and the Maldives Development Alliance, took 125 seats (11.4 percent) and 59 seats (5.4 percent) respectively.
The Adhaalath Party secured 45 seats (4.1 percent) – including a majority in three councils – while the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party won one seat (0.1 percent) and independent candidates won 132 seats (12 percent).
Voter turnout was 63 percent, well below the 90 percent turnout in the presidential election of November 2013.","As sole candidates, 13 councillors elected without contest",https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/as-sole-candidates-13-councillors-elected-without-contest-129550

“In order to reduce the number of such cases, we are expanding cooperation with international actors and are working on increasing the police’s capacity,” the police said in a tweet.

Ahmed Naiz from the Merry Lodge house in the Maafanu ward of Malé was charged with terrorism for allegedly participating in a foreign war, an offence that carries a jail sentence of up to 20 years.
The first hearing of the trial was closed to the public at the request of the prosecutor general’s office.
According to a spokesman, the judge granted Naiz’s request for time to appoint a lawyer before answering the charges.
The defendant was brought to court under police custody. The circumstances of his arrest or extradition remain unclear.
Naiz is the fifth alleged Maldivian jihadi fighter to stand trial since travelling overseas to join a militant group was criminalised by the 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act.

31,[],2017-01-17,,"President Abdulla Yameen plans to free up to 300 or more inmates convicted for petty crimes under a new clemency policy, Home Minister Ahmed Azleen announced Sunday.
The minister told inmates at the Maafushi Jail that Yameen “loves you a lot” and plans “to commute the sentences of our brothers and sisters in jail who fit a certain category”.
All inmates except for those found guilty of murder, terrorism, sexual assault and drug trafficking will qualify for a presidential pardon under the new rules set in December.
The regulation, titled “A special chance provided by the president to those who disavow criminal behaviour and want to reintegrate into society” applies to petty criminals who have served one fourth of their sentences.
The “special chance” appears to be a one-time opportunity, as the rules state that the committee to assess inmates’ eligibility will be dissolved after it makes recommendations to the president.
Azleen said: “We are about to see a lot of Maldivian inmates, whether it is 200 or 300 or even more of those who fall into these categories and those who filtered through, we hope they will get this very generous pardon by his excellency the president.”
The plan for mass pardons is the latest in an effort by the government to rehabilitate petty criminals: The prosecutor general’s office, under a policy deferring prosecution for first-time offenders, has declined to charge some 613 offenders since 2015, while the home ministry has expunged criminal records of thousands of young offenders.
The special chance policy will also help alleviate overcrowding at Maldivian prisons. The prison system has an estimated capacity of 885, but more than 1500 people were serving jail time at the end of 2015, according to government figures.
The vetting committee, to be set up by the home ministry, will review the inmate’s conduct in jail, past criminal record, remorse for crime committed, prospects for employment and willingness of families to facilitate their rehabilitation.
Inmates serving more than one jail sentence should have served one-fourth of their current sentence to qualify.
Urging inmates to pray to Allah for freedom, Azleen said: “In an instance where such a blessing is opening up, what should be most important for inmates is exceptional obedience and compliance with prison officer’s orders and keeping your behavioural conduct within those envisioned by prison officers so that you get first place.”
The home minister previously told local media that inmates who are freed must participate in programmes on “how to behave in society, religious norms, family relationships and other such matters.”
The new policy is based on wide discretion afforded to the president by the 2010 Clemency Act.
Article 29 of the law gives the president the discretion “to commute the sentence of a person convicted of a criminal offence on the grounds of age, health, treatment they are undergoing, their status and circumstances, or from a humanitarian perspective.”
Yameen has previously refused to use the clause to pardon jailed opposition leaders, such as former President Mohamed Nasheed, who was sentenced to 13 years in jail on controversial charges of terrorism.
“More discretion means more mistakes,” he said last May.
In June, he set rules limiting the discretion granted to him by Article 29, stating that inmates convicted of serious crimes, such as terrorism and murder, can only qualify for clemency after they serve half of their sentences.
Human rights groups alleged that the rules were set to block any legal avenue to release political opponents.
Statistics on presidential pardons are not publicly available.
The president’s office in April 2014 announced that Yameen has granted pardons to 169 convicts. He had commuted sentences for 24 inmates that January.
In July of the same year, he said criminal records of some 3,588 young people had expunged since he assumed office.
Critics claim the policies for young offenders are in fact aimed at buying the loyalty of Malé’s gangs. They point to multiple pictures of the president and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim with members of gangs and a 2015 incident in which Yameen pardoned an associate of a ruling party MP who was sentenced to ten years in prison on drug trafficking charges.
Ismail Shaheem’s release followed the Progressive Party of the Maldives-dominated parliament amending the clemency law to reduce the period an inmate must have served from one-third of sentence to one-fourth.
Shaheem was greeted at Maafushi Jail by PPM MP Ibrahim Shujau and alleged drug kingpin Ibrahim Shafaz. “Don’t say we CAN’T… HE IS OUT…,” Shafaz wrote in a Facebook post afterwards.
Nasheed, who was ousted following a police and army mutiny, met vociferous criticism by Yameen when he introduced a similar programme called the “Second Chance” in which prisoners were freed under a parole system.
Soon after Nasheed’s ouster, then-home minister Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed, who became Yameen’s vice president and is now the leader of the opposition, scrapped the Second Chance programme labelling it an attempt to “release unqualified criminals under political influence and without any clear procedure”.",Yameen to free hundreds of inmates locked up for petty crimes,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/yameen-to-free-hundreds-of-inmates-locked-up-for-petty-crimes-128422

A group of men with their faces covered reportedly handed out the letter to prayer-goers on Monday morning. The letter states that its content was taken from the website of Bilad Al Sham, a media group operated by Maldivians fighting in Syria with the al-Nusra Front, now called Jabhat Fatah al-Sham.
“What we have to remember is that obedience to parents is a fard al-ayn [obligatory for all Muslims] while jihad is a fard al-kifaya [not obligatory for all but when fulfilled by some, exempts other Muslims],” reads the letter.
“Nevertheless, in some circumstances, jihad becomes a fard al-ayn.”
The police spokesman said the incident has not prompted an investigation.
“We have heard about this. However, we haven’t been able to locate this letter or leaflet from anywhere, including social media,” he said.
“Such a case has also not been filed so we don’t have anything other than people saying it was distributed.”
According to the letter, its content was produced in March 2014 by Abu Dhujana, the alias of a Maldivian killed in the Syrian civil war in September 2014.
The letter concluded with a prayer for God to bestow blessings upon the “brothers” who operate Bilad Al Sham and to “grant the fortune to further publish beneficial writings such as this”.
Bilad Al Sham has reported the death of at least six Maldivians fighting with the then-al-Qaeda-affiliated militant organisation.
In June, the group released a YouTube video described as “a small warning” to Maldivian leaders.
Later that month, Defence Minister Adam Shareef Umar told the Maldives Independent that some individuals suspected of recruiting Maldivians for militant extremist groups are under surveillance.
No arrests have been made so far.
Many Maldivians in Syria – including couples who travelled with children, immigrations officers, and members of Malé’s criminal gangs – maintain regular contact with their families through social media.
A controversial new anti-terror law enacted in late 2015 meanwhile criminalised travelling abroad with the intent of joining a terror group. The first charges were raised in May against three Maldivian men arrested from the Turkey-Syria border, who have since pleaded not guilty.
But the government has been accused of ignoring the threat posed by jihadi recruitment since the first reports of Maldivians joining militant groups emerged two years ago.
The opposition claims as many as 250 Maldivians are now fighting in Syria and Iraq – the highest figure per capita in the region.
The government says the opposition has been inflating the figure to lobby international support for its cause.
In early August, the parliament approved the first state policy on combating terrorism and violent extremism, which broadly outlined plans to take “a central and active role” internationally, strengthen national security, and conduct de-radicalisation and rehabilitation programmes.
Critics who questioned the effectiveness of the harsh penalties in the anti-terror law had called on the government to undertake awareness programs to address radicalisation and to establish early intervention and rehabilitation programmes.
The Islamic ministry and scholars at the Fiqh Academy have also urged young Maldivians to refrain from participating in foreign wars.",Jihadi literature distributed after Eid prayer,https://maldivesindependent.com/society/jihadi-literature-distributed-after-eid-prayer-126523
33,[],2019-03-14,,"Former president Mohamed Nasheed was forced on the defensive Wednesday after religious scholars denounced comments he made at a campaign event about developing the burgeoning mid-market tourism industry.
Lauding the success of guesthouse tourism on local islands introduced during his administration, Nasheed appeared to suggest a “bigger profit” could be made by authorising the sale of alcohol.
“I’m certain no one would have thought we were opening a multi-million, billion dollar industry when we decided to give permits for tourist business on inhabited islands back in 2009,” he said Tuesday night on the Thoddoo island in Alif Alif atoll.
“But there are certain realities in this world. Perfume is what sells most in the world, and then chocolate, alcohol and cigarettes. We know when we do business with these things, there’s a huge profit and we get richer.”
He added: “Guesthouse tourism can be done much better in Maldives. If we really think about it, it becomes an undeniable reality that we can take a [bigger] profit from this business.”
The sale of alcohol and pork is prohibited by law on inhabited islands as their consumption is strictly forbidden in Islam. But both are readily available on “uninhabited” resort islands.
Taxes from tourism goods and services account for nearly 30 percent of government income.
In the face of accusations from religious scholars about pursuing a hidden anti-Islamic agenda, Nasheed insisted on Wednesday that he was not in favour of legalising the sale of alcohol.
“I don’t agree with selling alcohol on inhabited islands and I have not spoken in favour of it. Sad thing is those who spread this message and use religion as a weapon are the ones linked to the people who sells the most alcohol in Maldives,” tweeted the former president, now a Maldivian Democratic Party candidate for the April 6 parliamentary elections.
Religion is a hot-button issue in local politics.
Nasheed was accused of pursuing a secularisation agenda both during his three-year administration and his failed re-election bid in 2013. Religion was also a prominent part of the 2018 campaign with former president Abdulla Yameen accusing the opposition coalition of planning to introduce anti-Islamic practices to the 100 percent Muslim Maldives.
The sheikhs and scholars who denounced Nasheed’s alleged call to legalise alcohol sale included senior members of the Adhaalath Party, one of the four parties in the MDP-led ruling coalition, as opposition candidates also seized upon the controversy.
The MDP is competing against coalition partners as well as the opposition after deciding not to divide seats among the four coalition parties.
“The money earned from selling something forbidden by Allah will be haram,” Dr Mohamed Iyaz tweeted.
“While Allah has revealed that the sin in alcohol is bigger than its benefits, Muslims looking at only the benefits will condemn you to damnation in both worlds,” echoed Sheikh Ilyas Hussain, sharing a verse from the Quran.
Both scholars are senior members of the Adhaalath Party.
“I urge beloved Maldivians to stay cautious of outright sinful talk and hidden plans with evil intentions. Even if you fill your pockets with money, you go to the grave empty handed. For Muslims there is the afterlife as well, we must not forget,” Sheikh Ali Zaid warned.
“Don’t try to destroy the Islamic nationalism and discipline that’s been here for 800 years by showing people the fantasy of money. I call on all Muslim people not to vote for these people in the upcoming elections,” Zaid said in a second tweet.
In January, Nasheed was accused by prominent scholars of encouraging premarital sex for saying unmarried women should be prescribed contraception or allowed to have a tubectomy to prevent birth out of wedlock.
He later apologised for “misunderstandings” caused by his remarks, which he said was about children born out of wedlock who become vulnerable to drug addiction.",Nasheed denies backing alcohol sale at guesthouses,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/nasheed-denies-backing-alcohol-sale-at-guesthouses-144280

Commissioner General of Customs, Mohamed Junaid, told reporters that all vessels carrying pork and alcohol shipments will be tracked and monitored using satellite.
The aim is to ensure that pork and alcohol shipments end up in their approved locations.
It is a crime for Maldivians to consume pork or alcohol and such products are banned from inhabited islands. However, under a special permit, tourist resorts can offer these items to their foreign guests.
“We will know the resort to which the vessel has to transfer the goods. So we will know [through satellite tracking] if the vessel heads off or tries to head off to some other location,” Junaid said.
The new measure will help “somewhat control” the illegal smuggling of alcohol products, he added.
Customs also announced an increase of 42 percent in drugs confiscated by the agency while being smuggled in to the country.
Chief Superintendent Ismail Hamdhoon said 23 kilos of drugs had been confiscated so far this year, including 9.8 kilos of cannabis types and 8.9 kilos of heroin confiscated in 54 investigations.

The suspects were using the rented house for their illegal alcohol sales, the acting head of the drug enforcement department said Wednesday. Preliminary investigations have established that the alcohol was released from a bonded warehouse in Hulhumalé to a safari vessel, he added.
He appealed for cooperation from safari and speedboat operators and Malé homeowners to tackle the entrenched alcohol black market.
As alcohol consumption is prohibited by Islam, liquor import licenses are only issued to tourism businesses for sale to non-Maldivians.
Locals caught drinking alcohol are fined and sentenced to 40 lashes. A flogging sentence was most recently handed to a 27-year-old man who was found intoxicated by police officers in January last year.
A Maldivian consuming alcohol or pork is a class three misdemeanour in the 2014 penal code. A convict may receive a jail sentence ranging from six days to three months.
The law also gives a judge the authority to pass an additional sentence of 40 lashes, as consuming alcohol or pork is a hudud offence – a crime for which a punishment is prescribed under sharia law.

The sentence said the two man had admitted to “regularly drinking alcohol” during a police investigation and repeated this admission in court.
As a result, they were sentenced to 27 days in prison and a flogging of 40 lashes.
The judge commuted the jail sentence to a fine of MVR5,400 (US$350), which has to be paid to the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority within a month. Failure to pay the fine within the period will result in the original sentence of 27 days in jail, the sentence said.

Wisham’s wife Hana Waheed is a senior prosecutor at the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The couple is being held at the Dhoonidhoo Island Detention Center. They will be presented before a court within 24 hours.
Wisham is the latest government official to be arrested on criminal charges. In January, the police discovered a pistol and three bullets at defence minister Mohamed Nazim’s home in a late night raid.
He was sentenced to 11 years in prison on weapons smuggling charges in a trial widely criticised for lack of due process.

Some inquiries were launched without complaints being submitted, Mohamed Shaheeb told the press, including one case that led to an MVR1 million (US$64,850) fine imposed on Raajje TV for airing a speech that was deemed defamatory towards President Abdulla Yameen.
Shaheeb admitted a lack of impartiality when asked why defamation of opposition figures by pro-government media went unpunished. Inquiries launched by MBC members should not have targeted a single broadcaster, he said.
“I’m saying no political figure exerted any influence over me in any matter,” Shaheeb insisted, deferring to other members on questions over their independence.
Pressed about her role in organising an event for the president, MBC member Fathmath Zaina argued that Yameen’s meeting with senior citizens was “not a political rally.”
There was no problem with her attending as a member of a state institution, she contended.
Zaina, who worked at the first lady’s campaign office before her appointment to the regulator, was photographed handing out seating arrangements.
The Broadcasting Commission Act requires members to be “individuals who maintain socially accepted moral standards, integrity, good conduct, impartiality.”
Despite slapping fines totalling MVR3.7 million on the opposition-aligned Raajje TV, the MBC previously threw out complaints against state media.
The regulator was also accused of double standards after it ruled that questionable content aired by the pro-government Channel 13 was not defamatory.
But Shaheeb went on to defend the heavily-criticised anti-defamation law. It was necessary to protect the right to good reputation, he argued, adding that the number of complaints filed with the commission has declined since it came into force.
He also questioned the validity of the Reporters Without Borders’ annual press freedom index, declaring there was unprecedented freedom for Maldivian media.
The MBC “does not accept” the index as the France-based organisation did not seek any feedback or clarification from media regulators.
The Maldives was ranked 120 out of 180 countries this year after the murder of blogger Yameen Rasheed. In the 2017 index, the Maldives slid down five places to 117 following the criminalisation of defamation.
– Unfair and unbalanced –
Thursday’s press briefing was called to release a report on coverage of the presidential campaign.
The MBC’s content monitoring showed most TV stations, including channels operated by the state-owned Public Service Media company, were biased in favour of either the incumbent or opposition candidate.
The PSM News channel’s coverage of President Yameen was 97 percent positive, in contrast to 96 percent negative coverage of opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.
Coverage of the joint opposition candidate was 98 percent negative on the PSM’s Television Maldives channel.
Ahead of the September 23 polls, PSM aired several unsubstantiated allegations against Solih, including claims that he was suffering from a cognitive impairment.
Almost on a daily basis, the opposition coalition was branded unpatriotic, anti-Islamic and in cahoots with “Christian missionaries.”
A day before the election, PSM claimed Solih was banished in 1989 over illegal alcohol sales.

This is a Maldives Independent fact-check of what Yameen said.
– Gangs –
“I don’t think this [allegations about political influence on gangs] is research-based, scientific work. We actually don’t know the definition of gangs. However, there are neighbourhood groups, clubs and other groups involved in social and other activities. First of all, it is very difficult for me to address a part of Maldivian youth, Maldivian people, as gangs. The definition of gang has a negative connotation. So, normally, I don’t think these neighbourhood gangs and clubs will commit crimes. In the absence of any scientific research on this, I have never seen any research like this, I don’t believe that such big work [crime] can be done with these people.”
The definition of a gang is “an organised group of criminals.”
A rapid situation assessment of gangs in Malé was conducted in 2012 by the San Francisco-based Asia Foundation. The study, which is available online, explains the relationship that gangs have with politicians.
“Many gangs receive income through exchanges with political actors or business people and only a minority of gangs refuse to accept money in this way. The exchange is usually in the form of money, or sometimes alcohol, given to gangs to participate in political protests, start political riots, destroy property or injure a third party. Money is often given to a gang to initiate a fight so as to divert media attention from a political issue,” the study says.
Former home ministers and police chiefs have also talked about the impact gang violence has on crime rates. In 2014 a police chief inspector said a spate of violent assaults in Malé were gang reprisals. The same year a Maldives Broadcasting Commission survey of journalists found that gangs were one of the top sources of threats against journalists.
In 2016 a former home minister was placed under police protection after threats from a gang.
The Maldives even has a law titled “Prevention of Gang Crimes Act.” It covers witness intimidation, gang recruitment, turf wars, use of weapons and violent assault, as crimes committed by gangs in the country.
– System failure and Ahmed Adeeb –
“It is a problem with the system, I just explained it. That minister – don’t even ask about (him) being appointed to vice president – that minister would not have stayed on as a minister even if [corruption] was exposed through the system.”
Former vice president Ahmed Adeeb and the state-owned Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation were implicated in embezzlement from state funds in October 2014 — a year before he was arrested.
A 2014 audit report of the Tourism Ministry found the MMPRC obtained a USD$1million loan from another state-owned tourism company, in the guise of making an urgent payment to a foreign party, and loaned the money to a firm owned by Adeeb’s father.
Adeeb owned a 35 percent share in Montillion International Private Ltd, but transferred his stake to his father in March 2012 when he assumed the post of tourism minister. The company only made MVR70,100 in 2011 through trade. But, in the period between 2012 and 2014, USD$6.8 million and MVR3.6 million from tourism-related business rolled through the company’s accounts, the audit said.
The ruling party issued a statement condemning the report on the day it was published. The Progressive Party of the Maldives said the audit was politically motivated, baseless and intended to defame Adeeb – who was also the party’s deputy leader.
Auditor general Niyaz Ibrahim was removed from his office shortly after the report came out.
– Mangrove wasteland –
“It is very simple. Where is the scientific work [to prove detrimental nature of dredging lagoons and wetlands]?. Where is any scientific work done on this? What is the damage that has been done? First of all, the dredging of half of the mangrove of Kulhudhuffushi. We dredged less than half of the mangrove. What was in that area? Clean water or living fishes? It was a wasteland. Where are the environmental experts. Why didn’t they scientifically talk about this?”
A detailed environmental impact study for the dredging and reclamation of the Kulhudhuffushi mangrove area was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in October 2017. The study, conducted by contractors and available online, concluded the environmental impact of the destruction of the mangrove ecosystem would be irreversible.
“A total of over 1,200 trees (including bushes) may have to be removed for this project. This loss will be irreversible as the area has to be left cleared for the rest of the airport’s operational period.”
The report found that the clearing of vegetation in coastal areas would expose the island to severe erosion, periodic flooding and that damage from a tsunami would increase five-fold due to the removal of vegetation.
Birds, fishes and other wildlife would be severely affected due to the loss of habitat and vegetation.
“Furthermore, elevated level of greenhouse gas emissions will take place, since trees are a known carbon sink. In addition, changes to the vegetation within the island [are] imminent,” the report concludes.
The mangrove loss was given extensive coverage by local media.
– Guilty until proven innocent –
“In cases like this, after the prosecutor general looks in to the charges, if someone engaged in bribery it will be proven. If someone abused their authority it will be proven. The onus is on the person being charged to prove themselves innocent, from the investigation stage, from the charges, and even prove their innocence in court. So why don’t they go with the best lawyers in the world. Why do all of them [use their right to] remain silent? If they are innocent why remain silent? Respond [to the charges]. Declare their innocence to the investigation.”
The Maldives constitution includes the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty as a fundamental right of the accused, putting the responsibility of proving someone guilty on the shoulders of prosecutors and investigators.
The right to remain silent is also a fundamental right enshrined in the constitution, which is emphasised in the Criminal Procedure Code along with the right against self-incrimination.
Former prosecutor general Ahmed Muizzu told the Maldives Independent that using the right to remain silent is not an admission of guilt.
“Of course, it [remaining silent] is not [an admission of guilt]. The right to remain silent is a fundamental right. The burden falls on the state or the prosecutor general to prove the accused is guilty. The onus is not on the accused to prove his innocence,” Muizzu said.
– False domestic product –
“When I took over the government [the GDP] was at 4,000 or 5,000. Today the gross domestic product is 10,000 America [US] dollars. My hope is, with the will of Allah, if I am given the opportunity to complete these projects, this amount will move up to 20,000 America dollars.”
According to data published by the World Bank, the Maldives GDP per capita was between USD$4,000 and USD$5,000 in the mid 1990s. In 2014, the first year of Yameen’s presidency, the country’s GDP was at USD$8,124.

Cannot join those who have lost trust in protecting religion: Sheikh Abdulla (PSM)
Islam was at the forefront of the ruling party’s campaign. At a rally on Kudahuvadhoo island, the president’s running mate Dr Mohamed Shaheem recalled the lack of freedom for religious scholars during former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s 30-year reign. They are now free to preach without consequences, he said.
“How many scholars were jailed and tortured because of religious reasons? There was a time when women wearing a burqa were prohibited from going on TV. There was a time when the youth who wore face veil were picked up on the street and jailed. We experienced the time when our religious books were confiscated at the airport when we returned from studies.”
During former president Mohamed Nasheed’s three-year administration, he tried to allow the sale of alcohol on inhabited islands and branded prominent clerics as “terrorists,” Shaheem continued. In contrast, President Abdulla Yameen introduced Arabic language and Quran as new subjects and reviewed the curriculum to strengthen Islamic faith, he said.
He alleged that the opposition coalition was allied with “powers adversarial to Islam.”
State media reported a social media post with the photos of 66 scholars who support the president, noting that the majority of them had called on former president Mohamed Nasheed to repent for his alleged secularism and insults to Islam.
“But people who love religion are noting on social media that some of those who called for president Nasheed to repent are now supporting the opposition despite Nasheed not repenting for what he previously said,” the state-funded PSM claimed.

He shot back at the police threat of investigation, condemning the “intimidation” as well as the sacking of supporters from the civil service and government companies.
In recent weeks, several people have been sacked or transferred to other islands after greeting Ibu or attending opposition rallies.
Back in the capital, the lawmaker met with staff of Rehendi school. The teachers and staff endorsed Ibu because “they want to solve the problems and challenges facing the education sector,” according to the Maldivian Democratic Party.
Earlier this month, 20 teachers from the Iskandhar School in Malé also met with Ibu and declared their support. A pay rise for teachers is among the coalition’s education policy, which also includes a pledge for tuition-free college for undergraduates in the Maldives.
Earlier in the day, Ibu called on the government to allow foreign journalists to report from the Maldives. “Receiving worrying reports that President Yameen’s Government is blocking foreign journalists from freely covering the September 23rd election. I call upon all authorities to reverse restrictive measures against international journalists,” he tweeted.",Campaign trail: scholars and teachers,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/campaign-trail-scholars-and-teachers-141047

Mihaaru Daily quoted anonymous sources who confirmed to the newspaper that the accounts were back up and running. Avas and VFP, quoting their own sources, also reported that the accounts had been unfrozen.
Villa and the Maldives tax authority refused to comment on the reports.
The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Villa last week, saying the government had unlawfully revoked agreements for three islands and two lagoons in 2015.
Villa Group firms went to the Civil Court, which ruled that the government’s seizure of the properties was illegal.
But the High Court later overturned that decision and the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority sought to recover MVR 2.9 billion (USD$188 million) it said Villa owed as unpaid rent and fines for the properties.
The Villa bank accounts were frozen in 2015 and unfrozen in 2016, following the Civil Court ruling, then frozen again when the High Court overturned the lower court’s ruling.
A MIRA official previously told the Maldives Independent it would act accordingly when the Supreme Court ruling was officially received.
The verdict is a respite for Villa, which has experienced several setbacks since the JP split with the ruling coalition and allied itself with the opposition.
It axed staff in the months following the seizure of the properties. The government took over Kaadehdhoo airport, which was operated by Villa, and downgraded Villa’s Maamigili international airport to domestic status.

Villa group on Thursday said the chairman would discuss with the board possible legal action for the losses caused by the seizure of the properties.
The group’s company secretary, Ibrahim Rasheed, said MIRA should not keep their accounts frozen after the ruling.
Villa lawyers believe the group does not owe any money to the state as the “lawsuits have become baseless” following the Supreme Court ruling.
“We believe that Villa no longer requires to pay any money to MIRA or the state and the companies’ accounts which were frozen after the High Court ruling must now be unblocked,” said one lawyer, who wished to remain anonymous.
“That is because the Supreme Court has overturned the High Court ruling, so the lawsuits against Villa are now unfounded.”

But authorities raided the resorts and confiscated alcohol from them last month, ultimately revoking Royal Island’s license.

A police media official said the Maldivian suspect was taken into custody Monday night from the island in Gaaf Alif atoll. A 35-year-old Bangladeshi migrant worker was arrested in July in the previous case involving the same victim, the official confirmed.
A source close to the victim’s family told the Maldives Independent that the second suspect was a family friend, whom the girl’s relatives noticed was spending too much time at her house.
“The child was abused in her own home. He would come over to visit while she was watching TV,” the source said, adding that he “got into her head” after secret conversations.
“The family took the child to the local health centre to see a doctor. The doctor noticed signs of abuse and referred the family to a gynaecologist in [Gaaf Alif] Villigilli.”
According to the source, doctors confirmed that she was digitally penetrated.
On Tuesday, Sun Online reported a secretly-recorded phone conversation between the father of the victim and the suspect, who confessed to abusing the child.
The suspects are likely to face charges under the 2009 law on child sex offenders, which introduced special provisions such as withholding the right to remain silent and denying reprieve from detention during the investigation period.
The law prescribes jail terms up to 25 years.
The source familiar with the situation said the gender ministry has not been involved in the case, expressing concern that the victim is yet to receive psychological counselling or support.
Akram Hussain, a family protection consultant at the gender ministry, said there was no previous record of cases involving the six-year-old girl.
“As per our response criteria, a high priority case – such as sexual abuse – will be attended to within 24 hours,” he assured.
“We will ensure the child is in a safe environment where the perpetrator is not present. We will provide counselling to the child from trained social centres. We will be conducting a social inquiry assessment, which will help us come up with a three-month action plan.”

MDP Secretary-General Anas Abdul Sattar accused Staff Sergeant Ali Ahmed and Lance Corporal Ahmed Imthiyaz of physically abusing journalists during their arrest while covering an opposition protest last Wednesday night.
Anas told the press that the complaints were filed with the National Integrity Commission with sufficient evidence, including video footage showing a policeman kicking Raajje TV journalist Murshid Abdul Hakeem whilst others seized cameras and broadcasting equipment.
“We cannot accept unlawful acts and disproportionate force aimed at harming the people. We have requested the NIC to look into our complaints and take due measures,” he told the press on Saturday.
Following heavy-handed police crackdowns on opposition gatherings during the past week, opposition lawmakers and supporters on social media have been sharing photos and personal information of individual police officers accused of brutality.
Specialist Operations police officers routinely use pepper spray at close range to disperse opposition protesters.
The photo sharing prompted the police to warn of legal action against efforts to incite hatred and to undermine public trust in the institution.
The ruling Progressive Party of Maldives also issued a statement backing the police and condemning the alleged incitement to violence against police officers and their families.
“Until the police stop brutalising people you cannot stop people from expressing opinions targeted at them. We will take action against brutal police officers,” tweeted exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed in response to the police statement on Thursday.
Opposition MP Abdulla Riyaz, a former police commissioner, told the Maldives Independent that he did not believe watchdog bodies are capable of holding the police accountable.
“The independent commissions are unable to function properly. They are not carrying out their responsibilities very effectively,” the lawmaker said.
“Delays in investigations and taking measures are also an obstruction to justice. Even the oversight bodies are not functional. The 241 committee [parliamentary oversight committee for the security services] has not held a meeting in three years.”
He added that “the best practice is to seek official solutions by submitting complaints to the respective authorities.”
Mohamed Hameed ‘MC,’ a former police intelligence chief, meanwhile suggested that the “use of excessive force is largely due to culture of impunity and the non-existence of a proper policing landscape.”
The former officer expressed doubt as to whether the internal ‘Use of Force Review Committee’ has been recording and reviewing every instance where an officer used force against a member of the public.
A previous warning by the police against posting photos of individual officers had sparked a social media outcry in March 2015 with dozens of Twitter users posting pictures of police brutality with the hashtag #NameThatPolice.
On February 8, 2012, at least 71 people were hospitalised after a police crackdown on MDP supporters that was described by the human rights watchdog as “brutal” and “without warning.”
However, not a single police officer has been convicted over the well-documented acts of brutality before and after the transfer of presidential power.
In November 2015, a police officer caught on tape kicking and beating Ahmed Shahid, husband of MDP MP Eva Abdulla, on the morning of February 7, 2012, was cleared of charges by the criminal court.
In September 2015, the criminal court also acquitted former policeman Ali Ahmed despite video footage showing the then-staff sergeant kicking a protester on the ground. In May last year, two policemen charged with assaulting former MP Mohamed Gasam during the crackdown were found not guilty.
More recently, a man found guilty of assaulting MP Mariya Ahmed Didi on February 7 was fined MVR200 (US$13) last May.
In the wake of the February 8 crackdown, videos emerged on social media showing SO officers brutally beating MDP MP Ibrahim Rasheed ‘Bonda.’ The police watchdog later concluded that excessive force was used but dropped several cases citing lack of evidence to identify the perpetrators.
Al Jazeera filmed parts of the crackdown, reporting that “police and military charged, beating demonstrators as they ran – women, the elderly, dozens left nursing their wounds”.

63,[],2015-10-06,,"The government of President Abdulla Yameen of the Maldives continues to abuse an overbroad anti-terror law as a blunt-force tool to arbitrarily and indiscriminately silence perceived political threats to his regime.
During a recent visit to the Maldives last month, I was alarmed by the numerous and increasing number of terrorism trials against public officials. While international attention has relaxed in recent months following former president Mohamed Nasheed’s medical leave to the UK pending appeal of his own terrorism conviction from last year, President Yameen’s government continues to use a deeply politicized criminal justice system to persecute anyone out of favour with the President, be they opposition party members, judges, even former cabinet members and erstwhile allies.
In October 2015, for instance, then-Vice President Ahmed Adeeb was arrested in connection with a suspected bomb blast on a boat carrying the President, even though a US FBI investigation was unable to conclude that the explosion was caused by a bomb. The then-VP was subsequently summarily impeached and soon thereafter charged with several counts of corruption and terrorism.
During a 15 February 2016 hearing, a terrorism charge based on an alleged firearm seen in the former VP’s residence in April 2015 was formally presented and disclosed to the defense for the first time, though the defense continues to be denied access to the evidence or witness list in this case on national security grounds.
A second charge of terrorism against the former VP, this one in connection with the alleged bomb blast on the President’s boat, was filed on 17 March. The defense was not formally notified of this new charge, only learning of it through media reports. Here too, the defense is yet to be given access to any government witnesses or evidence relating to the charge.
Such denial of access to evidence and witnesses contravenes the right to prepare an adequate defence and the right to test evidence, fundamental components of the right to fair trial.
On 16 February, leader of the opposition Adhaalath party, Sheikh Imran Abdullah, was convicted and sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment on terrorism charges in connection with a public speech given during an opposition protest rally.
The disproportionately severe punishment in Sheikh Imran’s case – a 12-year ‘terrorism’ sentence for a political speech – was the outcome of an arbitrary and unfair trial process fraught with apparent fair trial violations, including allegedly doctored evidence.
Two more recent victims of inappropriate ‘terrorism’ charges are Magistrate Judge Ahmed Nihan and former Prosecutor General Muhthaz Muhsin, both of whom were arrested on 7 February in connection with an alleged ‘forged’ arrest warrant against the President for his alleged role in a major corruption scandal involving the embezzlement of several million dollars of state funds. On 8 March, more than one month after the arrests, both were charged under sections 4(a) and 5(a) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2015, for conspiring to ‘kidnap’ the President.
Meanwhile, on 15 March, former Defense Minister Col. (retd.) Mohamed Nazim’s conviction on ‘weapons smuggling’ charges (based on the discovery of one pistol and three bullets allegedly found in his home in January 2015) was upheld by the appellate High Court, one year since his conviction and three months since the final hearing in his appeal. The ICJ has previously documented in detail, in its August 2015 fact-finding report, the substantial fair trial violations in Col. Nazim’s investigation and trial, including indications that the weapons in question were planted, that implicate an arbitrary, unfair and politically motivated proceeding.
There is a clear pattern here of the Maldives government seeking to neutralize certain political actors through arbitrary, heavy-handed and politically motivated abuse of the anti-terrorism law that amounts to a flagrant violation of the basic international principles of fair trial, judicial independence and separation of powers. It is also a clear breach of the Maldives’ international legal obligation to respect the right to fair trial under article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the Maldives acceded in 2006.
The misuse of anti-terror laws in the Maldives seems part of an effort to halt and reverse the progress made during the country’s brief democratic transition after 2008. As the country faces growing political unrest and instability, President Yameen’s government must restore the rule of law, strengthen the judiciary and other democratic institutions, and set the country back on the path towards a more representative and accountable government.
An important first step in doing so is immediately ceasing from using the anti-terror law as a political weapon to chill the actions of public officials and silence real or perceived political opponents, and ensuring that those currently facing criminal charges are provided a fair trial in accordance with the Maldives’ international human rights obligations and its national laws.

“The knife in the kitchen can be used to cut vegetables or kill a person. Every law is like that. Govt will NOT abuse the Anti-Terrorism Act,” Naseer said in a tweet.
The government-sponsored legislation was passed with 49 votes in favour, 22 against, and three abstentions. The ruling Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) and coalition partner Maldives Development Alliance control 49 seats in the 85-member house.
MPs of the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) had submitted 11 amendments to the bill, all of which were rejected.
At a press conference held by MDP earlier this week, MP Imthiyaz Fahmy had also expressed concern with the law’s broad definition of terrorist activities. It would allow the authorities to interpret “legitimate peaceful political activities” as terrorism, he said.
The religious conservative Adhaalath Party was the latest to join calls for amendments to the law.
Anara Naeem, the only MP representing the Adhaalath Party, said: “The act declares exerting undue influence on the state and inciting fear as terrorism, but it fails to define what may be considered as “undue influence” and “fear inciting activities.'”
“We will review the bill further and submit for the annulment of articles in the act that contravenes the constitution,” Ali Zahir, the Adhaalath Party spokesman, added.
On social media, Maldivians, including a former human rights commissioner, former attorney general and MPs tweeted against the bill using the hashtag #MvTerrorBill.

Pro-government MPs, meanwhile, have defended the legislation, insisting that it was necessary to effectively combat terrorism and assuring that it would not be used to target political opponents.
Inciting violence at demonstrations and threatening the country’s independence and sovereignty will be considered acts of terrorism. The offence carries penalties of up to 25 years in jail.
Encouraging terrorism, an act which carries a jail sentence of between 10 to 15 years, is also defined as “a speech or statement perceived by the public as encouragement of terrorism.”
In March, former President Mohamed Nasheed was sentenced to 13 years in prison over the arrest of a judge during his tenure. He was charged under the 1990 Prevention of Terrorism Act, which will now be replaced by the new anti-terrorism law passed today.
Adhaalath Party President Sheikh Imran Abdulla is also facing trial on a terrorism charge. He is accused of inciting violence at a mass anti-government demonstration on May 1.

Facilities on seven islands will reportedly be funded from the state budget and loans from OFID. More than MVR104 million for the other 25 islands comes from the Green Climate Fund.
The 10-month project involves setting up tanks to store rainwater along with units to filter, disinfect and store clean water.
The contract was signed just three days before the presidential election.
But a project to deliver clean water to 30 percent of the population with funding from the Green Climate Fund was signed with the UNDP in May 2017.
No new contracts have been signed since under the Green Climate Fund, UNDP confirmed to the Maldives Independent.
“The Maldives has only one GCF project supported by UNDP, entitled ‘Supporting Vulnerable Communities in Maldives to Manage Climate Change-Induced Water Shortages,'” a UNDP official said.
“The project aspires to provide safe and uninterrupted drinking water for up to 49 islands of the Maldives.”
An environment ministry spokeswoman said the GCF funds were being utilised for the 32-island project. It was “hard to say” why it was not done sooner, she said.
The five-year project by the UNDP “targets 49 islands across 13 atolls of the Maldives that continue to experience water shortages linked to low rainfall and extended dry periods brought on by a changing climate.”

Hafiz Saeed and Ali Abdul Sattar, from Gaaf Dhaal Vaadhoo and Malé, were handed the flogging sentence Sunday by the Criminal Court.
The sentence said the two man had admitted to “regularly drinking alcohol” during a police investigation and repeated this admission in court.
As a result, they were sentenced to 27 days in prison and a flogging of 40 lashes.
The judge commuted the jail sentence to a fine of MVR5,400 (US$350), which has to be paid to the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority within a month. Failure to pay the fine within the period will result in the original sentence of 27 days in jail, the sentence said.
A Maldivian consuming alcohol or pork is a Class 3 misdemeanour, listed under Public Order and Safety Offences in the Maldives Penal Code. A convict may receive a jail sentence ranging from six days to three months.
The law also gives a judge the authority to pass an additional sentence of 40 lashes, as consuming alcohol or pork is a hudud offence – a crime which sets a punishment under sharia law.
Although the Maldives legal system is a combination of sharia law and common law, sharia sentences are uncommon.
An amendment brought to the Penal Code in 2015 requires all appeal processes be exhausted before Islamic sharia punishments can be meted out.

69,[],2017-05-10,,"Businesses and households in Malé have been struggling to buy drinking water for the past five weeks amid an acute shortage caused by a fall in production coupled with high demand during the dry season.
In an announcement Tuesday, the economic development ministry urged shops not to sell the locally produced bottled mineral water at inflated prices. The price of a case has reportedly increased by up to MVR10 (US$0.60) in some corner shops.
Some shops also stopped selling water in early March and others have been rationing sales. Shops and businesses say daily supplies have been hard to purchase or entirely unavailable for delivery from the main producers.
“I’ve been calling the lines for water delivery, but they don’t pick up anymore. We went to the warehouse where they store water, but they didn’t have enough water available either,” a businessman who wished to remain anonymous told the Maldives Independent about difficulties in buying water to serve at his café.
“We had to go to the T-jetty, where they had a couple of palettes of water, and bring it to our café by ourselves,” he added.
With desalinated tap water unsafe to drink without boiling, the 150,000-strong population in the congested capital city rely on bottled water from three main suppliers – Island Beverages, Malé Aerated Water Company and Happy Market.
According to local media, the shortage in recent weeks was mainly caused by low supplies of the Taza or Life five-litre bottles bought by most households.
On Sunday, Happy Market told local media that the company’s production of the Life brand fell after a suction pump broke at its water plant on the island of Himmafushi near Malé.
But Managing Director Ali Ihusan assured that production will return to normal within a week. He also suggested that bulk buying of bottled water during the hot northeastern monsoon contributed to the shortage.
Temperatures have reached 34 degrees celsius during the past month.
Following the low supplies of the rival Taza brand in recent weeks, Ihusan said the demand for a five litre Life water bottle increased from 20,000 to 30,000 a day.
The withdrawal of a batch of Taza bottles due to a noticeable unpleasant smell in early March coincided with the problems at the Happy Market water plant.
At the time, the Island Beverages company temporarily suspended production of the five-litre Taza bottle.
But on Monday, Island Beverages assured the public that it has increased production of Taza bottles to maximum capacity.
The bottling plant is now operational for 24 hours, the company said. The government-owned Malé Water and Sewerage Company owns a majority stake in Island Beverages.
The State Electricity Company meanwhile introduced its bottled water to the market last week. But the state-owned company has limited capacity and is able to provide 10 cases per order daily.
Fazul Rasheed, managing director of MWSC, told newspaper Mihaaru earlier this week that the company expects the water shortage to be resolved next week.

In partnership with the state-owned Waste Management Corporation, the Rahdhu (Return) project offers MVR1 for a bottle.
During the pilot phase from Tuesday to Saturday, only bottles with a particular sticker sold in shops, cafes and restaurants near the WAMCO office in Hulhumalé will be refunded, Ahmed Afrah Ismail, a spokesman from Rahdhu told the Maldives Independent.
The bottles have to be returned to the WAMCO office near Centro Mall or the waste disposal area in the northwest corner of Hulhumalé, a reclaimed island connected via a bridge to the capital.
“We will put out 10,000 bottles with stickers and see how many are returned,” Afrah said.
The team hopes to achieve a return rate of at least 80 percent. The results of the pilot programme will inform whether it could be rolled out nationally, he said.
In the future, the plan is to hand over the project to WAMCO to run as a consumer deposit scheme with a deposit of MVR1 being added on top of the cost of a water bottle.
The team hopes the project would also reduce the burden on WAMCO to keep the streets clean.
According to WAMCO, the company spends MVR2.5 million every month to collect litter.

More than 280,000 plastic water bottles are used daily in the capital alone. Most households rely on the locally produced bottled mineral water for drinking.
But water piped to households by the Malé Water and Sewerage Company is of the highest quality in South Asia and “well above” World Health Organisation standards, Environment Minister Dr Hussain Rasheed Hassan assured at a press briefing.
A multi-agency effort involving the environment’s ministry’s water department, the health ministry, the Environment Protection Agency, and the Maldives Food and Drug Authority was launched as part of the new administration’s campaign against single-use plastics.
Ensuring the safety of tap water is also a target of the government’s first 100-day action plan.
The president’s office banned single-use plastics in December and most government offices have since introduced glass bottles.
Seeking to counter the common perception that tap water is unsafe for drinking, EPA and MFDA officials made presentations and stressed that water is tested at three different stages before it is supplied to households.
Tap water is produced in the Maldives by desalinating salty groundwater taken from boreholes on islands.
The state-owned MWSC also plans to publish water testing results once a week in a bid to gain public confidence.
Environment Minister Dr Hussain said efforts were under way to draft national regulations on installing water pipes at households to avoid contamination.
EPA deputy director general Ibrahim Mohamed said the agency was working on a “container deposit scheme” as part of a bottled water recycling programme.
There were bottled water shortages during the dry season in the past two years. After production companies halted deliveries in April last year, shops started rationing and the price of the smallest bottle rose to MVR15 (US$1).

In order to stop the open burning of garbage, Maalhos, Dharavandhoo and Kihaadhoo in Baa atoll – a UNESCO biosphere reserve famous for whale shark and manta ray sightings – aim to create “eco-centro” facilities to sort, recycle and reuse waste, a “waste-to-wealth model” pioneered at Soneva Fushi.
“At the resort, food and organic waste, metals, and bottles are chipped, ground down or composted, and turned into things of economic value, such as concrete building blocks and fertilizer,” Soneva explained in a press statement. “Plastic waste is either recycled or used to create useful new objects.”
The open burning of garbage on local islands poses a public health and environmental hazard, a longstanding problem that has been worsened by plastic waste pollution with bottles, bags and other detritus littering beaches, smothering coral reefs and killing marine life.
Open burning is expected to end in Maalhos after the island’s eco-centre becomes operational by September.
The island councils of Maalhos, Dharavandhoo and Kihaadhoo pledged to end open burning during a workshop held at Soneva Fushi in early January.
The council presidents formed a partnership with Soneva Fushi and Common Seas, an international NGO dedicated to reducing marine plastic pollution, to launch the waste management initiative, dubbed ‘Namoona Baa Atoll’ (Exemplary Baa Atoll).
“The new partnership – part of the international Clean Blue Alliance which supports islands to prevent plastic waste leaking into the ocean – sets a course for Baa Atoll, and eventually the Maldives, to become a global leader in halting ocean plastic pollution,” according to Soneva.
Plastic is toxic when ingested by plankton, fish and other marine animals. Reefs are at risk as corals that consume microplastics are unable to expel the tiny fragments.
“As an island that relies heavily on guest house tourism, this is an exciting prospect for Dharavandhoo,” said Ali Maajidh, Dharavandhoo council president.
“Dealing with the current volume of single use plastic waste is expensive for communities to manage, off-putting for tourists, and harmful to fish stocks,” observed Jo Royle, managing director and founder of Common Seas.
“The items most commonly found on Maldivian beaches are plastic bottles, disposable nappies, cigarette butts, straws and plastic bags, so we already know where start.”
According to Soneva, 90 percent of waste generated on its two resort islands in the Maldives is recycled or reused. A decade ago, branded bottled water was discontinued in favour of producing drinking water on site in reusable glass bottles, which it says prevented the production of 1.5 million single-use plastic bottles.
Some 104 million non-biodegradable plastic bags were imported in the Maldives last year and more than 280,000 plastic water bottles are used daily on the capital island.
In recent weeks, several government offices have banned the use of single-use plastic bottles as the new administration launched a campaign against plastic pollution.
Parley for the Oceans, a US-based organisation, is working with resorts, schools and fishing vessels to intercept plastic, which is then shipped abroad for recycling. It is making design-wear from plastic waste.
“If we work together, we are sure we can create the right environment for the Maldives to be the world’s most progressive country on single use plastic,” said Sonu Shivdasani, CEO and founder of Soneva.

76,[],2018-09-23,,"People reported waiting up to six hours to cast their vote in the Maldives presidential election Sunday, as long lines persisted at polling stations more than halfway through the day.
There are about 262,000 eligible voters. Elections Commission member Ahmed Akram told the Maldives Independent that turnout had reached 38 percent by noon.
Polls close in less than an hour, but queues stretched outside most schools where polling stations were set up in the capital.
In Kuala Lumpur people fainted while waiting, leaving others in the queue to manage the line and arrange for drinking water. Queues were said to extend from the 10th floor to the ground floor. There are almost 1,900 people registered to vote in Kuala Lumpur, but only one ballot box.
In Colombo, where there are two ballot boxes for around 2,800 voters, the former EC head Fuwad Thowfeek told the Maldives Independent there was no organisation.
“It was overcrowded, uncomfortable. I saw people pushing. I am not very good at pushing. So after waiting for an hour, we decided to return later,” he said.
There was one official checking ID in Colombo. By noon, just a few hundred were said to have voted. There were arguments and people were leaving without casting their vote.
There are between six and eight officials at most other polling stations however.
One official lets people in and prioritises the elderly, election monitors and pregnant women.
A second enters voters’ ID card details into a tablet to see if he or she is registered at that polling station. That official gives out a queue number. It is the first time tablets are being used in a Maldives election.
A third official checks the ID card against a list and looks at peoples’ faces to confirm it is them on the ID card. A fourth marks fingers with voting ink. A fifth gives out the voting card.
Once the ballot paper is marked a sixth official holds open the ballot box.
Election law states that those waiting in line by the time polls close are entitled to cast their vote and that ballot boxes should be sealed once everyone in the queue has deposited their voting slip.
In 2013 there were 239,621 registered voters and the number of votes cast was 218,621. The turnout was 91.41 percent.
Transparency Maldives, which has almost 400 election observers, said polling had started smoothly.
The majority of ballot centres were open by 8:30am and candidates were well represented. Voting materials were present and ballot boxes were verified as empty at the start.","Long lines, fainting and shoving: Maldives voting proves slow-going",https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/long-lines-fainting-and-shoving-maldives-voting-proves-slow-going-141433

President Abdulla Yameen attended the opening of the new runway at the Velana International Airport. It was marked with the landing of an Etihad Airways A380 jetliner with the triumphant national football team.
With the airport expansion paving the way for exponential growth in tourist arrivals, he predicted state revenue would reach MVR82 billion (US$5.3 billion) a year, up from about MVR20 billion at present. The horizon is limitless under his captaincy, he said.
Yameen falsely claimed that the state was paid just MVR15 million in the first year the airport was managed by Indian developer GMR, whereas the Maldives Airport Company Ltd used to earn MVR200 million a year. According to a special audit, the government earned MVR1.3 billion from the airport in 2010, followed by MVR687 million in 2011, far higher than before privatisation.
GMR was paid US$271 million as compensation for the wrongful termination of the 25-year concession agreement.
On Tuesday night, Yameen released his re-election manifesto at a rally organised to show the “real size” of the ruling Progressive Party of the Maldives. The manifesto is a roadmap for doubling GDP per capita, he said.
In an impassioned speech, Yameen said he has delivered housing for all, jobs for youth, an MVR5,000 monthly allowance for the elderly, specialist doctors, and the means for workers to increase their income.
His administration has weathered storms without the captain jumping ship, Yameen said. “This ship moves swiftly. This ship can’t be stopped. This ship can travel on rough seas. But this ship’s engine needs oil. That is up to each one of you,” he told supporters.
Dismissing allegations of massive corruption as defamatory and unwarranted, Yameen accused former president Mohamed Nasheed of selling government shares in the water company and telecom giant at incommensurate prices. The Dhiraagu majority stake was divested to Cable & Wireless after a visit from a member of the British royal family, he alleged.
He slammed the opposition manifesto pledge of legislative approval for the four-party coalition agreement. Parliament is not a place for registering marriage and divorce, he said, reiterating criticism of power-sharing in an executive presidency.
Among the achievements of the past five years were providing sewerage services for 70 percent of the population and access to clean drinking water to half the population, he claimed, as well as developing VIA, completing 12 regional airports, building harbours on 130 islands, and ensuring public order and stability.
“I want each one of you to believe the truthfulness of my intentions. I have done a lot of work to deliver what Maldivians want.”
Yameen drew fire on social media with some of his remarks. A young man without the means to buy a phone for his girlfriend would “beg, borrow or steal,” he said.
The “mega rally” was planned after a massive turnout at an opposition rally in Malé. With supporters brought to the capital on chartered flights, the PPM said the turnout exceeded 20,000. The opposition, however, put the figure at about 8,000.

After visiting all inhabited islands between himself and the running mate, joint opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih ‘Ibu’ met with various groups in the capital.
On Tuesday night, he took part in a question and answer session organised by Raajje TV. Maldivian jails are unfit for humans, he declared, vowing to improve conditions in line with commitments under international conventions. He expressed concern over the numerous custodial deaths in recent years.
Ibu pledged to reform Aasandha to ensure that health insurance services are available without discrimination based on political affiliation. The coalition government would also provide subsidies for families unable to afford high rents and issue housing loans at a six percent interest rate and MVR5,000 monthly payment.
Among other pledges were pay hikes for civil servants, soft loans for students, and a mechanism to ensure resort workers are paid mandatory service charges.

78,[],2018-09-19,,"The Maldives ruling party Tuesday night launched its election manifesto, days before voting is due to take place and months after it was promised by President Abdulla Yameen.
Yameen, who is seeking a second term in office, launched the Shared Progress manifesto at a rally in the capital, where supporters gathered to show the “real size” of the ruling Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM).
The manifesto makes a number of eye-catching projections, including the increase of GDP from MVR70 billion in 2018 to MVR175 billion in 2023 and boosting jobs from 250,000 in 2018 to 663,000 in 2023.
“Tonight we have unveiled a manifesto that will double our income. That means this manifesto will raise our income to USD$20,000 if we currently get USD$10,000,” Yameen told the crowd.
He has shown a shaky grasp of facts and statistics in recent weeks.
The total registered Maldivian population at the end of 2017 was 378,114, official figures say.
It is expected to reach almost one million by 2054, according to UN estimates, with Maldivians comprising 57 percent of that figure.
The manifesto’s job claim would mean that, by 2023, there are more jobs than there are Maldivians.
Yameen said earlier this week that the GDP was USD$4,000 or USD$5,000 when he took office and that the GDP was currently USD$10,000. Neither of these assertions are true.
World Bank data says the Maldives GDP per capita was between USD$4,000 and USD$5,000 in the mid 1990s.
In 2014, the first year of Yameen’s presidency, it was USD$8,124. The GDP per capita for 2017 was recorded at USD$8,980 – short of the USD$10,000 claimed by Yameen.
The election is scheduled for September 23.

79,[],2018-08-12,,"The world’s largest and the Maldives first 3D-printed reef was installed by a resort at the weekend, with the technology being used to help protect coral reefs.
The artificial reef, assembled with hundreds of ceramic and concrete modules, was submerged in seven metres of water in a part of the lagoon where Summer Island Maldives is building a new coral reef ecosystem.
Coral reefs are under threat from climate change. In 2016 a particularly strong El Nino weather event, which caused sea temperatures to spike, devastated coral reefs across large parts of the Maldives. Climate change makes these coral ‘bleaching’ events increasingly likely and severe.
The project started in Australia, where industrial designer Alex Goad of Reef Design Lab used computing modelling to design reef structures similar to those found naturally in the Maldives.
A 3D printer took 24 hours to print moulds which were then cast in ceramic, an inert substance similar to limestone rock, and shipped to the Maldives. They were filled with marine concrete on the resort’s beach before being taken into the lagoon and assembled.
Like a giant aquatic LEGO set the 220 ceramic, concrete-filled moulds were slotted together underwater to create the new reef.
Coral fragments, grown on the resort’s existing and extensive coral nursery, were transplanted onto the 3D reef. In a few years, when the corals have colonised the reef, the resort wants a new reef teeming with fish and other marine life.
If the 3D printing technology proves successful, it could be a new way of helping coral reefs adapt to a warming climate.
“This is a science project, it’s a research project,” said Alex Goad. “3D printing technology helps us to mimic the complexity of natural reef structures, so we can design artificial reefs that closely resemble those found in nature.”
Goad will make his modular 3D designs open source, so other researchers in the Maldives can benefit from them without having to pay a licence fee.
The resort aims to study the reef with the help of marine biologists over the next few years, to see if the 3D version is better at encouraging coral growth than existing methods of artificially growing corals, such as with steel frames.
It has also introduced other environmental initiatives including the adoption of solar energy, a ban plastic straw usage and phasing out imported drinking water.
Resort manager Mari Shareef said these policies were popular among guests and staff.
“We want to help promote a culture of environmental stewardship, not just at Summer Island, but across the Maldives,” she said.",3D printing technology to aid coral growth in Maldives,https://maldivesindependent.com/environment/3d-printing-technology-to-aid-coral-growth-in-maldives-140073
80,[],2018-06-25,,"President Abdulla Yameen on Sunday dismissed criticism of mounting foreign debt during a campaign trip to three islands in Malé atoll.
Speaking on the island of Thulusdhoo, Yameen said opposition leaders have confessed to the public that they lack the competence or capability to repay the country’s debt.
“My thinking is, I will still increase the debt. I will still increase the debt, I will deliver what the people want, I will do everything that the people have been lacking,” he declared.
External debt reached US$1.2 billion last year as global financial institutions warned that the Maldives was at risk of debt distress. The opposition contends failure to repay US$1.5 billion borrowed from China for the current administration’s flagship projects could facilitate “land grabs”.
But the government says the large-scale projects such as the upgrading of the international airport are necessary to exponentially increase arrivals and expand the lucrative tourism industry beyond the central atolls.
In his next stop on Maafushi island, Yameen insisted that his administration has only taken on new debt with the capacity for repayment. It did so after clearing an inherited debt of MVR29 billion (US$1.8 billion), he added.
“Years of development have come during a short period of four or five years. But if we didn’t take on debt as I said, and waited to do it with the income the Maldives earns, God willing we’re trying to do things that couldn’t have been done in 10 more years,” he said.
During the Kaafu atoll tour, Yameen opened new harbours in Thulusdhoo and Guraidhoo, marked the completion of a beach protection project in Maafushi, and inaugurated clean drinking water services in Guraidhoo.
In Maafushi – a guesthouse island hailed by the World Bank for pioneering mid-market tourism – Yameen announced that a large plot of beachfront land that houses the juvenile reformatory will be given back to the island council.
He also revealed plans to lease five lagoons in Malé atoll for resort development.
Aside from criticism over the jailing of opponents and curtailment of political freedoms, Yameen’s administration has also been under fire from environmentalists over the destruction caused by large-scale infrastructure projects.",President scoffs at concern over mounting debt,https://maldivesindependent.com/business/president-scoffs-at-concern-over-mounting-debt-138922
81,[],2018-05-28,,"The Islamic ministry has revoked the preaching licence of Sheikh Ali Zaid and said the cleric is under investigation, local media reported.
The licence was suspended from Monday, according to a ministry media official. He did not know the duration of the suspension.
The official said Zaid was being investigated in connection with several complaints, but refused to disclose details.
Zaid also refused to comment when contacted by local media.
On Saturday night he said in a Facebook post that he was aware of what the Islamic ministry was trying to do and called on “those involved in this to fear Allah.”
He has criticised the government recently and urged the education ministry to cleanse itself of “secular people” after the Islamist NGO Jamiyyathul Salaf accused the ministry of obstructing gatherings.
He has tweeted about being blocked from carrying out religious events and sermons in the atolls, but did not say who prevented him from doing so.
The ministry media official denied his accusations and told Sun Online there was no bar to holding gatherings or giving sermons “in accordance with the rules.”
Zaid was summoned to the Islamic ministry last Ramadan for saying that 70 percent of the people from one Maldivian island do not fast during the holy month.
The Maldives has been declared a 100-percent Muslim country and all able-bodied Maldivians are compelled, by law, to abstain from eating and drinking during the day in Ramadan.
Zaid has also attracted controversy for saying that people who favour same-sex marriage should be killed and warned of “divine wrath” for people who plant false evidence.

82,[],2018-04-17,,"Film! Fashion! Food! The Maldives has enjoyed a long love affair with all things Indian, from the silver screen to the catwalk and dinner table.
The Indian town closest to Malé – Thiruvananthapuram – has signs in Dhivehi and residents who speak the Maldivian language fluently. And tens of thousands of Maldivians travel to India every year, as much for medical treatment as the country’s cultural familiarity.
In politics, India has played the role of protector by ensuring the safety and security of the little archipelago. Rajiv Gandhi diapatched troops in 1988 to save Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s government from invading Tamil mercenaries. More recently, when fire damaged Malé’s desalination plant, India sent navy ships and aircraft laden with drinking water.
But the Maldives-India jodi is on the rocks, at least on the political front, as President Abdulla Yameen repeatedly spurns India in favour of China’s embrace.
The credit for starting the diplomatic anti-India baiting could go to former president Mohamed Waheed. He threw out India’s GMR from the Maldives, cancelling a US$511 million dollar deal with the firm to develop the international airport.
He also went on an infamous Twitter rant accusing India of interfering in the Maldives’ internal affairs. His outburst was all the more surprising, given that his government was legitimised in large part by Manmohan Singh recognizing the highly controversial transfer of power.
— A frayed knot —
The GMR fiasco led to the first thread unravelling in the tight bond that had previously entwined both countries for decades. The last months of Mohamed Nasheed’s presidency were marred by anti-GMR and anti-India protests.
The opposition whipped itself and its supporters up into a nationalistic frenzy, replete with ‘GMR Go Home’ balloons and speeches full of racist comments about India.
When then vice president Waheed was propelled into the top office following Nasheed’s controversial exit, it was only a matter of time before GMR was booted out.
But relations between the Maldives and India have sunk to new lows — and remain on a downward trajectory — since Yameen was sworn into office.
What has upset the Indians so? In a word, China. Yameen’s decision to let China muscle in on what has long been considered Indian territory – the Indian Ocean – has rankled New Delhi no end.
Yameen’s government amended the constitution in 2015 to allow foreign parties – with over a billion dollars to spend – to buy land in the Maldives. The move was widely perceived as opening the door to Chinese and Saudi acquisitions.
Last year, a Free Trade Agreement between the Maldives and China was also rushed through parliament under highly controversial circumstances, and quickly ratified by Yameen.
To add insult to injury, almost every single major infrastructure project that Yameen has signed has been with a Chinese company: a ‘friendship’ bridge, 7,000 housing units, a hospital building, the Hulhumalé megawatt power plant and the Laamu link road.
Andrew Small, an expert on China and author of The China-Pakistan Axis: Asia’s New Geopolitics, says an accumulation of things have wound India up.
“It has happened in stages, played over a long arc,” he tells the Maldives Independent. “China’s systematically embedding themselves economically in the Maldives with the security implications that follow, via the FTA, the money they have put into projects, the changing of the constitution in order to allow them to buy islands.”
— Red Lines —
The latest uproar follows the government’s attempts to return two helicopters given to the Maldives by India. The helicopters are used by the Maldivian military to transport critically ill patients and for search and rescue operations. The return of these gifts is considered a slap in the face for New Delhi.
Even more alarming for India was the visit of Pakistan’s army chief and subsequent announcement that Pakistan warships may patrol the Maldives’ Exclusive Economic Zone alongside Maldivian coast guard vessels. Indian officials quoted in the Indian media said that joint monitoring exercises with Pakistan would be a red line for New Delhi.
“The Chinese are seen as strategic rivals, but Pakistan is an outright adversary. Direct military cooperation between the Maldives and Pakistan will not be viewed well in India,” says Small.
He says New Delhi would be anxious if it appeared that Pakistan was doing China’s bidding when it comes to the Maldives.
“India understands that cooperation with China in economics and trade may bring with it some security cooperation too, and China has broader goals in the Indian Ocean. But adding Pakistan into the security mix, which is more clearly directed at India, causes a different kind of concern in New Delhi.
“A red line of sorts was crossed when Yameen extended the state of emergency, and not much was done, the Indians didn’t act forcefully. There isn’t much appetite in Delhi for military action,” says Small.
Not only did Yameen’s government ignore India’s pleas and extend the SOE, it also accused India of distorting the facts and issued a public rebuke of its erstwhile ally.
One of Yameen’s ministers, who was tasked with briefing foreign media at that time, went so far as to say that India should mind its own business and stay away from the Maldives’ internal affairs.
Small suggests that, rather than an overt military response, India is more likely to use its political influence to maintain pressure on the Yameen administration and help the opposition in the run-up to this year’s presidential elections.
But there is mounting scepticism over whether Yameen will hold free and fair elections. If those elections are rigged, and Yameen remains in power with Chinese support, it remains to be seen what India will do.
Are Maldivians ready to give up Indian dhal and settle for Chinese takeaway? There doesn’t seem to be much appetite for it among the public, even if the government is keen for a menu change.

Local media reported that supplies are low for the Life brand produced by Happy Market and the Taza brand produced by a subsidiary of the Malé Water and Sewerage Company.
According to shopkeepers, Happy Market and MWSC have stopped taking orders for five-litre bottles until next week.

84,[],2016-12-10,,"The broadcast regulator has thrown out a libel complaint against the state TV in a decision that stands in stark contrast to action it has taken against opposition-aligned outlets for defaming President Abdulla Yameen.
The Maldives Broadcasting Commission, when asked to investigate Public Service Media for questioning former Presidents Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Mohamed Nasheed’s Islamic faith, dismissed the petition saying the pair had shown no interest in pursuing the matter.
“Since the former presidents have not submitted a complaint over defamation, the members of the commission agreed that the commission will not take the initiative to investigate,” the MBC said Wednesday.
The anonymous complaint was the first filed at the MBC under a new law criminalising defamation.
Both Nasheed and Gayoom had opposed the Defamation and Freedom of Expression Act and said they would not seek legal action under that law.
Had the PSM and the author of the report been found guilty, they would have faced fines of up to MVR150,000 (US$9,727) and MVR2million (US$130,000), respectively.
Failure to pay the fine could result in a jail term of six months for the author and suspension or cancellation of PSM’s broadcasting license.
The MBC’s refusal to investigate the complaint against PSM came a day after the vice president of the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party, Mohamed Shifaz, was questioned by the police on charges of slandering a former member of that party.
A journalist from newspaper Mihaaru was also summoned.
Rights lawyers have meanwhile criticised the MBC for rejecting the PSM complaint, saying Article 27 of the law authorises the media regulator to initiate investigations into and take action against defamation.
“The nature of a criminal offence is that law enforcement bodies are required to launch investigations regardless of whether a complaint is withdrawn,” a lawyer who wished to remain anonymous said. “The aim of the law is to punish offenders, not protect victims.”
A second lawyer noted that the MBC had penalised opposition-aligned Raajje TV before the law’s enactment ordering it to take down articles and apologise for defaming the president.
The PSM’s controversial news report was aired on prime time on its news channel, Television Maldives, on August 11, a day after the parliament approved the defamation law
The report interpreted Gayoom’s opposition to the law as support for the “secular policies” of his political rival Nasheed.
“We are now starting to believe that Maumoon, like Nasheed, will start advocating in his tweets for Maldivians to behave like white people, to back-bite and criticise, and not stay sober all the time,” the report said, and went on to allege that Gayoom was in talks with the opposition to ensure he was given the title of “Maldives’ supreme leader” and facilitate his son’s rise to power.
In the face of widespread outrage, TVM took off the video feature and an accompanying article from its website.
Shortly after, the commission received an anonymous complaint seeking action against the channel for calling Gayoom and Nasheed ‘un-Islamic’ in its report.
At the time, several journalists expressed scepticism over the media regulatory body’s willingness to take strict action against PSM.
Niumathulla Idrees, a journalist with Mihaaru, wrote: “If this were a report broadcast by private media about government officials… I am sure they will be fined, journalists locked up and media houses shut down.”
The MBC has also previously dismissed defamation complaints against pro-government TV station, Channel 13.",Media regulator throws out libel complaint against state TV,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/media-regulator-throws-out-libel-complaint-against-state-tv-128007
85,[],2016-08-13,,"Public Service Media, the Maldives’ state broadcaster has taken down an online article accusing former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of being anti-Islamic.
PSM triggered a storm of criticism as it posted the article, just a day after the ruling Progressive Party of the Maldives approved a widely condemned law criminalizing defamation.
Gayoom, who is locked in a battle with his half-brother, current President Abdulla Yameen, for the control of PPM, had appealed to MPs to reject the bill.
“Integrity and courage are crucial for success in all political endeavors. If we allow fear to restrict our actions we will never deliver,” he said in a tweet soon after losing the vote. Only four ruling coalition MPs, including Gayoom’s son voted No. Three others did not attend the vote.
PSM interpreted Gayoom’s tweet as support for what it calls the secular policies of exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed, the Maldives’ first democratically elected president who had ended Gayoom’s 30-year rule.
“President Maumoon’s sudden change of stance, in line with Nasheed’s, and encouragement of fun without fear came as a surprise to many. This raises questions over what the nearly 80-year old Maumoon may say next,” a broadcast of the report aired on PSM’s Television Maldives said. “We are now starting to believe that Maumoon, like Nasheed did, will start advocating in his tweets for Maldivians to behave like white people, to back-bite and criticise, and not to stay sober all the time.”
The term fun without fear refers to Nasheed’s sports pledge, unveiled during the 2013 presidential elections, which his opponents had claimed would encourage anti- Islamic activities in the Maldives.
Citing unnamed media reports, PSM went on to allege that Gayoom, who is currently abroad, was in talks with the opposition to ensure he is given the title of Maldives’ supreme leader and to facilitate his son’s rise to power.
“The state broadcaster is 38 years old. I have never seen such a deplorable article on TVM yet,” wrote Hussain Hussain, a Sun Online journalist and member of print and online media regulator. “What will be the result of stoking the fire of hate that burns here?”
Lawyer Maumoon Hameed, Gayoom’s nephew, said: “Is this going to be the first case investigated by police under the new defamation law?”
The Defamation and Freedom of Expression Act became law on Thursday. It sets fines of up to MVR2million (US$130,000) for content or speech that is defamatory, threatens national security and breaches social norms.
Failure to pay the fine can lead to a jail term of up to six months, and closure of newspapers and other media offices.
Niumathulla Idrees, a journalist with Mihaaru, wrote: “Will the defamation law be applied over PSM? Will any state institution believe that the article was defamatory? Will they investigate if a complaint is lodged? If this were a report broadcast by private media about government officials, what would have happened now? I am sure they will be fined, journalists locked up and media houses shut down.”
PSM’s CEO, Ibrahim Khaleel, was not responding to calls at the time of going to press.
The broadcast regulator, Maldives Broadcasting Comission, has meanwhile appealed to all journalists to respect the defamation law.
The commission, which was reconstituted in April, has been accused of bias and discriminatory treatment. While it has ordered opposition aligned Raajje TV to take down articles and apologise for defaming the president, critics say it has refused to take action against pro-government Channel 13 when it broadcast similar remarks against opposition figures.

86,[],2016-05-11,,"The Maldivian economy slowed to 1.9 percent growth in 2015, knocked by a slowdown in tourism arrivals and a number of booking cancellations following a state of emergency in November, the World Bank has said.
The figure stated in the World Bank’s bi-annual report, South Asia Economic Focus, is markedly different to the 4.8 percent touted by the government, and comes as a blow to President Abdulla Yameen, who came to power promising strong economic growth.
This was the weakest showing since 2009, when a global recession led to negative growth of -3.9 percent in the Maldives. In comparison, 2014 saw growth rates of 6.5 percent.
The economy was dragged down by a slump in tourist arrivals, especially from China and Russia, the report said. Construction has now overtaken tourism as the most important driver of growth.
Continued domestic political unrest and a slowdown in major-tourism providing countries, such as China and European states, might lead to further reduction in arrivals, affecting tax receipts and the economy, the report said.
Despite record revenue, the Maldives is spending beyond its means, the World Bank continued, warning of “significant” risks.
Figures on fiscal deficits and public debt were sobering, too; the 2015 deficit stood at 8.4 percent of GDP, and not 6 percent as claimed by the government. This makes it the highest deficit since 2010 (14.4 percent).
The risk of external debt distress is high owing to large infrastructure projects, the report said. These projects, cornerstones of Yameen’s economic agenda, include airport expansion, a bridge between the capital Malé and Hulhumalé, and housing construction in Hulhumalé.
Public debt could rise from 73 percent of GDP or US$693.7million to 120 percent of GDP by 2020, the report warned, recommending Yameen’s administration to rein in spending and implement more sequencing of investment projects to contain debt.
Managing a constrained cash flow “has become an increasing challenge,” the report noted, leading to the build-up of unpaid bills and costly domestic borrowing. A heavy reliance on domestic sources of financing is meanwhile exposing the domestic banking system to sovereign risk, it added.
The bank went on to express concern over high youth unemployment, saying rates had increased from 9.3 percent in 2006 to 12.4 percent in 2014. This was caused by “skill mismatch and lack of local economic opportunities.”
Women’s participation in the labour force, however, increased.
Inflation fell to 1.4percent while the exchange rate of MVR15.4 per USD has remained stable.
This is because the tourism industry appears to be supplying quantities of foreign exchange at a stable premium over the official exchange rate, the report stated.

He is due to take the oath of office on November 17.
The president-elect also met EU ambassador Tung-lai Margue and French ambassador Jean-Marin Schuh, both of whom are based in the neighbouring Sri Lanka.
Solih expressed gratitude for the EU’s efforts for democratic reform in the Maldives and discussed assistance in reforming institutions and climate change adaptation projects. With the French ambassador, he discussed strengthening bilateral ties and increasing tourist arrivals from France.
In his first official visit to the country, Mark Field also held talks with Foreign Minister Mohamed Asim and Speaker Abdul Maseeh Mohamed as well as the leaders of political parties. He was accompanied by British ambassador James Dauris.

“The Secretary congratulated the Maldivian people for coming out to vote in overwhelming numbers despite challenges. The Secretary noted that the election reflected the will of the Maldivian people, which all parties in the country should respect. He said the United States looks forward to President-elect Solih’s inauguration in November and expanding U.S. cooperation with Maldives in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

89,[],2018-05-15,,"President Abdulla Yameen has extended the term of a commission formed to recover stolen assets until November 2018.
The commission was formed for a one-year period in July last year to oversee the recovery of funds flagged as stolen by the Auditor General and the anti-corruption watchdog.
Home Minister Azleen Ahmed, chair of the five-member commission, told the press Tuesday that the state was owed MVR29.7 billion (US$1.9 billion) from various parties, up from the previously floated figure of MVR13 billion.
The amount eclipses the entire state budget for 2018.
The commission has concluded cases worth MVR3.8 billion so far, Azleen added, some of which have been forwarded to the Attorney General and Prosecutor General’s offices.
“Some money has been recovered through the commission’s efforts and some money is at the repayment stage,” he claimed, without disclosing details.
Azleen dismissed criticism that the commission targets the president’s political opponents. The recovered funds could be used for development projects, he said, accusing previous administrations of failing to take action.
The cases before the commission include failed state-owned enterprises Fisheries Projects Implementation Division (FPID) and Air Maldives Limited under former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom’s 30-year administration.
The FPID corruption scandal 27 years ago led to the dissolution of the subsidiary of the State Trading Organisation and the formation of Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company.
Air Maldives, the first national carrier of the country, declared bankruptcy in 2000 after incurring losses estimated at US$50-70 million, amid allegations of mismanagement and corruption.
The commission is also trying to recover nearly US$80 million stolen from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation under the current administration’s watch.
The embezzlement of resort lease payments and other funds from the state-owned MMPRC was the biggest corruption scandal in Maldivian history.
Asked if the commission was looking into corruption cases in the present government, Azleen said: “Corruption belonging to this government hasn’t come to us. There isn’t any corruption that belongs to any government. It’s the people who carry out the corruption that it belongs to, isn’t that so?”",Asset recovery commission’s term extended to November,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/asset-recovery-commissions-term-extended-to-november-138156
90,[],2017-07-20,,"President Abdulla Yameen has formed a commission to oversee the recovery of state assets flagged by the Auditor General’s office and the anti-corruption watchdog as misused or stolen.
Home Minister Ahmed Azleen was appointed as chair of the five-member State Assets Recovery Commission along with President’s Office Minister Mohamed Muhthaz, Khadeeja Hussain, Dr Ibrahim Mahfooz, and Mohamed Saleem.
Briefing the press at the president’s office Thursday morning, Attorney General Mohamed Anil said the commission is tasked with reviewing cases highlighted by the oversight institutions as well as the recovery efforts to date.
“The commission will have the discretion and power to send cases to the finance ministry where action is required to recover funds as well as to the Attorney General’s office to pursue civil litigation,” he said.
The commission can summon people for questioning and seek criminal prosecution, he added.
Anil said the SARC was formed for a one-year period to recover “hundreds of millions of Rufiyaa owed to the state” after deliberations at Monday’s cabinet meeting.
The commission will periodically update the president as well as the Prosecutor General, Auditor General, and the Anti-Corruption Commission.
The Auditor General’s office has released numerous reports of ministries and government agencies flagging the misuse or theft of state funds since the office was set up as an independent oversight body in 2008. But the total amount owed to the state is unclear.
In August last year, the finance ministry ordered former President Mohamed Nasheed and six senior officials of his administration to repay “misused” government funds.
The seven were told to reimburse the treasury within seven days or face lawsuits. Anil told the press in late June that two of the former officials have since settled their debts whilst the state will pursue litigation against the rest.
Last week, a lawsuit was filed against Nasheed’s former housing and environment minister Mohamed Aslam to recover MVR312,928 (US$20,294) he had used on mobile phone bills.
Anil also said efforts are underway to recover nearly US$80 million stolen from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation under the current administration’s watch.

The council has donated some MVR200,000 (US$12,970) to the recovery fund, while the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party raised MVR 29,00 (US$1,880) this weekend.
The government is awaiting a report from Finance Minister Abdulla Jihad and is yet to make an estimate of recovery costs.
Twelve hours of torrential rain a week ago left parts of Addu City under a foot of water. Some streets were impassable, while flood water damaged household appliances and furniture in hundreds of households.
The rainfall was the heaviest Addu City has seen in 40 years, according to the department of meteorology.
“We estimate the people suffered a loss of more than MVR3million (US$194,550). Most have lost almost all of their household items like furniture. Due to this we have not been able to return the city to normal state,” Thoyyib said.
The Feydhoo and Maradhoo-Feydhoo wards suffered the worst damage.
With the help of the security forces, excess water has been pumped out or diverted to the ocean by digging canals.
“The victims don’t need us going over there with our big suits and ties. They want help, money and that’s what we are trying to get them. But so far we have been able to collect just over MVR200,000 (US$14,000),” Thoyyib said.
Finance Minister Jihad visited Addu earlier this week as President Abdulla Yameen’s special envoy and inspected the affected households. A special report will be handed to the president this week, he said.
“The report has been late but we will finish it soon. We don’t know yet what the extent of damage is but it will be clear once the report is finished,” he said. “The president will decide how to deal with the situation in Addu.”

Navaanavai met the press Tuesday to introduce its two candidates, Fathimath Rishana for the Central Maafannu constituency in the capital and Ahmed Mohamed ‘Forme’ for the Dhaalu Kudahuvadhoo constituency.
Both were endorsed after a thorough vetting process, spokeswoman Fathimath Saaira told reporters.
Rishana and Forme are among a few independent candidates who have have disclosed their personal finances. Detailed statements made public included the income and assets of their immediate family.
Rishana also pledged to publish an audit of campaign finances after the April 6 polls.
“This is something no candidate from any party in Maldives has ever done,” she said.
“The excuse parties give not to do this is that it’s not mandated by the law. The law does not forbid it either. So if you have any sincerity, show your finances to the people.”
Financial statements are necessary for voters to understand conflicts of interest, said Rishana, who has a background in disaster management, having worked on the 2004 Tsunami recovery programme and later in the Maldives Red Crescent.
The long-awaited report of the country’s biggest corruption scandal released last week showed how politicians use relatives and front companies for money laundering, she observed.
– Money and politics –
“The biggest problem in Maldives right now is the influence of big businesses and black money in politics. Politicians and parties are deep in the pockets of big businessmen,” said Forme, a human rights defender who previously worked at Transparency Maldives.
He cited the unprecedented theft of US$90 million from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation as evidence of the influence of “black money” on political parties and state institutions.
“This was an organised crime done by big businessmen, political parties and state institutions together. It shows the extent that stolen black money has gone into the pockets of political parties and political leaders,” he continued.
“People currently in the ruling coalition were also very much involved and they even benefitted from it. During the past five years, we saw parliament unable to find out the truth about this, and they wanted to hide it more. What is even more worrying is that MMPRC money is being spent on and by candidates running from these parties. Majlis 19 will not have integrity if this is happening.”
Regardless of the merits of a party’s legislative agenda, “nothing that truly benefits people will happen as long as the people in parliament are businessman and their associates with conflicting interests,” Forme contended.
He criticised President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih for attending the opening of resorts that were leased through the MMPRC and called on the government to take back the islands.
“This is not zero tolerance to corruption,” he said, referring to the new administration’s anti-corruption drive.
– “A higher standard” –
Navaanavai hopes their campaign will push voters to question candidates and parties about their finances.
“Even if we run for just two seats, we are setting a high standard with our campaign. Publishing financial statements and campaign finances. It’s pressure for all constituencies,” Rishana said.
“As long as political parties do not publicise financial statements of candidates and the party’s finances, any talk of cleaning out the parliament or having a zero tolerance to corruption is just that, talk.”
The ruling Maldivian Democratic Party has asked its 86 candidates to submit asset declarations but is yet to make statements public.
The president and his cabinet’s personal finances were disclosed last month, the first time it was done by any administration. But the assets and income of spouses have yet to be made public as pledged in the new government’s 100-day action plan.
Voters must also push candidates and parties to be more transparent, Forme added.
“We urge people to ask their candidates ‘where’s your financial statements? Why are family statements or foreign investments not included in it?’ Now there’s also a lot of talk about cleaning out the Majlis. When you talk about cleaning the Majlis, political parties must tell people who’s funding the parties,” he said, referring to the MDP’s recent campaign slogans.
Campaign finances for last year’s presidential election have not been released, he noted, stressing that the identity of donors and financiers remain hidden from the public.

More than US$90 million stolen from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation was funnelled through a private company into the bank accounts of 155 individuals, the Anti-Corruption Commission revealed in December.
It was the first time the watchdog revealed details of a probe launched before the unprecedented theft was exposed in a damning February 2016 audit report, according to which acquisition fees paid for islands and lagoons leased for resort development was embezzled from the MMPRC.
In a statement Monday, the local chapter of Transparency International welcomed recent developments in the MMPRC scandal.
Last week, police asked the Prosecutor General’s office to press charges against former president Abdulla Yameen over alleged money laundering and lying to the Anti-Corruption Commission during its investigation. Charges were also sought against Yameen’s lawyer and former legal affairs minister Azima Shukoor, who was accused of being an accomplice.
The anti-corruption NGO called the charges “a step forwarding in eliminating corruption.”
But the failure to disclose the identities of the 155 individuals who received the stolen funds was “an obstacle in finding out the truth and prosecuting all perpetrators involved in this case.”
In the face of a growing public outcry on social media, the ACC told the media on Monday that the commission’s five members were considering whether further information could be revealed.

But the public needs to know who the 155 individuals are in order to make informed choices before the April 6 parliamentary elections, Aiman Rasheed, Transparency Maldives’ advocacy and communications manager, told the Maldives Independent.
“The main activity through which citizens hold their representatives to account is through elections. Many beneficiaries of the MMPRC embezzlement who are currently in parliament, are likely running for parliament this year,” he said.

Adeeb, who is serving 33 year for corruption and terrorism, was taken back to prison last week after more than a month under house arrest, a move condemned by his Maldives Third-Way Democrat party as contrary to doctor’s recommendation to keep him home for two months to recover from a surgery to remove kidney stones.
It is unclear why Adeeb required emergency treatment after he was returned to the high-security jail.
The Maldives Correctional Service said Adeeb’s wife will be able to stay in his hospital room for 24 hours. Family members will be allowed access during visiting hours.
After Adeeb’s family expressed concern with his health in custody last week, the MCS told the press that he was being kept at the special protection unit, which it assured was safe and appropriate for his condition.

“I am pleased to announce that we’ve committed US$ 10 million to Maldives – US$7 million in foreign military financing to support Maldives maritime security and control its territorial waters and US$3 million to support civil society and help protect Maldives environment,” said David J. Ranz, the deputy assistant secretary of the central and south Asian affairs.
Ranz met reporters during an official visit to the Maldives with a delegation including senior officials from the Department of Justice, US AID, and the State Department’s bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement..
The Maldives is a critical partner in President Donal Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy, he said, adding the US delegation has held discussions to “expand the partnership”
“The election of President Solih and subsequent peaceful transfer of power was a major democratic movement and one that we view as profoundly significant for the whole region,” he continued. “The goal of our trip has been examining ways that we can expand our partnership with the Maldives in pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific, including how to be supportive during this critical period of transition.”
Discussions with the Maldives government focused on objectives and challenges and how the US could support strengthening democracy, improving governance, enhancing security and promoting development, Ranz said.
The delegation also discussed providing capacity building and training for Maldivian investigative authorities to help carry out probes into public financing management, asset recovery, and debt management.
But the US would not actively participate in any domestic investigations unless the Maldivian government sought consultancy, Ranz stressed.
“One of the goals of the Indo-Pacific strategy is to ensure that countries receive investments that is economically viable, that ensure sovereignty and and ensure they’re able to make decisions that are in best interests if the country and their people,” he said.
“We’ve seen in the region examples where countries have promoted investment that wasn’t designed to be a benefit to the people and wasn’t designed economically or commercially viable,” he said, referring to Chinese financing of the previous administration’s infrastructure projects.
“That has not been positive for those countries or the region. Many countries have begun to push back, the Maldives is one of those countries that I think has begun to push back with the new government. So one clear area is ensuring that the investment you receive is going to be a benefit to the Maldivian people and contribute to your economic growth and prosperity.”
The US would also help the Maldives develop its ability to patrol territorial waters under the security initiative.
This would include helping to develop the island nation’s ability to to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters, Ranz added, noting that heavy rainfall flooded the capital Malé just last week.

About 10 Progressive Party of Maldives MPs sought to block a vote on accepting the bill for consideration, claiming it was “unconstitutional.”
Speaker Gasim Ibrahim insisted there was no legal obstacle as the legislation was cleared by the counsel-general. But he adjourned the sitting without a calling a vote as the PPM lawmakers continued to loudly protest in front of his desk.
Two inquiry commissions were formed by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih on his first day in office to fulfil campaign pledges to recover missing funds and find the truth behind high-profile murders and the abduction of a journalist.
According to the proposed law, the commissions would become investigative agencies with powers to obtain search warrants, collect evidence, summon suspects, freeze bank accounts, and to seek assistance from police as well as foreign investigators.
A special department must be formed under the assistant prosecutor general to expedite cases forwarded by the commissions. Trials must be concluded within two months after charges are filed.
During the debate after the bill was presented by Maldivian Democratic Party MP Mohamed Rasheed Ibrahim, PPM MPs questioned why the mandate of the commissions was limited to cases between January 2012 and November 2018.
The intent was to jail senior officials of former president Abdulla Yameen’s administration who plan to contest in the upcoming parliamentary elections, they contended.

The ‘Presidential Commission on Corruption and Asset Recovery’ was formed due to the “failure of investigative bodies” to recover stolen funds and hold former government officials accountable for graft and abuse of power.
Along with chairman Ahmed Assad, a former state minister of finance, the commission’s members are Gaas Abdulla, Nadheem Ibrahim, and Fathmath Sarira Ali Shareef.
Former president Yameen was dogged by allegations of corruption after the unprecedented theft of nearly US$80 million from the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation.
The embezzlement of resort lease payments was exposed in a damning February 2016 audit report.
The Anti-Corruption Commission is yet to disclose long overdue findings of a probe launched in 2016.
Last November, the anti-corruption watchdog confirmed longstanding allegations that a local company implicated in the corruption scandal deposited US$1 million into Yameen’s private account at the Maldives Islamic Bank.
But Yameen denied any involvement in the scandal and pinned the blame on his jailed former deputy.
The commission on murders and enforced disappearances was mandated with conducting “a free, independent and trustworthy investigation” into cases between January 1, 2012 and November 17, 2018 that were “not properly investigated for various reasons.”
The commission is comprised of former attorney general Husnu Suood as chair along with Abdulla Munaz, Adam Ibrahim, lawyer Fareesha Abdulla and journalist Misbah Abbas.
It is expected to probe the murders of lawmaker Dr Afrasheem Ali and liberal blogger Yameen Rasheed as well as the abduction of Maldives Independent journalist Ahmed Rilwan.
Dr Afrasheem, a moderate religious scholar, was stabbed to death at the stairwell of his home on the night of October 1, 2012. Police claimed the killing was politically motivated but no charges have been raised over the alleged funding. Hussain Humam, a young man charged over the murder, is the only person convicted so far.
Yameen Rasheed, an IT professional and satirist, was killed by a radicalised group of young men who believed he was guilty of insulting Islam, according to police. Six suspects were charged with murder and preliminary hearings were wrapped up last month.
Yameen’s family questioned the ability of the police to conduct an impartial and credible investigation due to the failure to convict or arrest suspects in the abduction of journalist Rilwan and the near-fatal attack on blogger Hilath Rasheed.
Days before the fourth anniversary of Rilwan’s disappearance in August, two suspects were acquitted with the judge blaming glaring investigative and prosecutorial failures.
The missing journalist’s family said the not guilty verdict showed “at minimum state complicity and, at worst, active involvement in Rilwan’s abduction and disappearance.”

Along with releasing political prisoners, launching efforts on the first day in office to recover stolen money and find the truth behind murders and disappearances were pledges made by the joint opposition candidate.
In particular, he pledged to seek justice for the murders of lawmaker Dr Afrasheem Ali and liberal blogger Yameen Rasheed as well as the abduction of Maldives Independent journalist Ahmed Rilwan.
Both commissions were instituted by presidential decree hours after Solih took the oath of office Saturday.

101,[],2018-10-09,,"The Anti-Corruption Commission has authorised the housing ministry to resume the halted Hiyaa social housing scheme and the sale of plots from the capital’s suburb Hulhumalé.
At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Housing Minister Dr Mohamed Muizz announced that application forms for the 400 plots will now be available until the end of Sunday.
He called the land reclaimed for Hulhumalé phase two “a shining example” of President Abdulla Yameen’s housing policy.
“It is his legacy. Every grain of sand in that place will always show his legacy,” he said, scolding journalists for “irresponsible” reporting of the anti-corruption probes.
Muizz announced the sale of the 400 plots last Sunday in defiance of the incoming administration’s call not to sell state assets before the transfer of power on November 17.
The anti-corruption watchdog halted the process after complaints from the president-elect’s representatives.
In a press statement released shortly after Muizz’s press conference, the ACC said it has told the housing ministry to devise and announce criteria to identify Malé residents most in need of housing.
But the housing ministry resumed accepting forms at 4pm in apparent disregard of the ACC instructions.
The 1,000-square feet plots from the capital’s suburb are to be sold for MVR400,000 (US$25,940) each.
Applicants must be married and registered residents of Malé who would not inherit a plot larger than 600-square feet. Payments can be made in instalments over 10 years with an MVR25,000 down-payment to the Housing Development Corporation, the state-owned enterprises tasked with the urban development of Hulhumalé.
Successful applicants would be chosen at a lucky draw next week, Muizz said. All applicants who score 100 points would go into the pot.
Addressing criticism over the comparatively low price, Muizz said the purpose of a social housing scheme was to offer affordable prices.
The price was determined by the cabinet’s Economic and Youth Council chaired by the president after taking into account the HDC’s “cashflow problems” and recovery of investment.
“Hulhumalé is an asset of HDC…The ministry’s role is to select a buyer’s list. We will not sell the land, HDC will sell the land. HDC will receive the payments.”
The company will soon announce bidding for 100 beachfront properties at medium to high-end rates, he added. Bidding will start at MVR2,000 per square feet.
– Hiyaa –
Housing is a hot-button issue in the Maldives, where 39 percent of the country’s 341,256 population lives on the 2.2 square mile island of Malé.
The Hiyaa project was launched by President Yameen in November last year with state-owned enterprises to finance the construction of more than 17,000 flats in Hulhumalé phase two.
After Muizz briefed the press, the ACC said the housing ministry has been instructed to announce details of how points were awarded after applications are evaluated.
The list of flat winners must be finalised after allowing adequate time for complaints and responding to each in writing, the commission said in a statement.
Muizz said the list would be published on Tuesday. Construction of 7,000 flats is expected to be complete by next April, he said.
Some 22,700 forms were submitted by the end of September, he revealed.
As only 299 people applied for 455 flats under the category for doctors and nurses, Muizz said all applicants will be awarded flats.
The remaining flats would be allocated to teachers, 735 of whom applied for 625 flats under their category.",Halted housing projects resume after anti-corruption probe,https://maldivesindependent.com/politics/halted-housing-projects-resume-after-anti-corruption-probe-141949

According to Raajje.mv, a money laundering case involving transactions worth millions of rufiyaa linked to President Abdulla Yameen was reported mid-September to police by the Maldives Monetary Authority’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).
According to CNM, the FIU wrote to police on September 13 asking for the case to be investigated. But there is still no active investigation and police have not decided to reject the case either, the website reported
A police spokesman refused to comment.
Mohamed Nasih, a central bank official, said he could neither confirm nor deny whether a case had been sent to police.
“Under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, we are not allowed to disclose whether or not we have sent any particular case to an investigation authority,” he told the Maldives Independent.
“Even though the FIU is an institution within the MMA, it operates completely independently,” he said.
Yameen has been dogged by graft allegations since he took office, including that he was involved in the country’s biggest ever corruption scandal tied to the state-owned Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation (MMPRC).
In 2016 a deposit slip made public showed US$500,000 was deposited into a Maldives Islamic Bank account in Yameen’s name.
Some US$80million, paid as acquisition fees for tourism leases, had been siphoned off since Yameen assumed power, according to an audit report issued in 2016.
The anti-money laundering law requires the FIU to look into unusually large transactions and all unusual transaction patterns.. But the MMPRC case went unreported until former vice president Ahmed Adeeb’s arrest in October 2015.
Earlier this month, the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party renewed allegations about a plot to launder US$1.5 billion in cash through Maldivian banks in 2015. It cited a report by KRyS Global, a Cayman Islands-based asset recovery firm.
The plot was also featured in the Al Jazeera documentary Stealing Paradise, along with the MMPRC scam. According to the documentary, the money was to be flown to the Maldives and transferred to a vault at the central bank under the supervision of local soldiers, after which it was to be credited to a private company account and transferred out.
It showed a late-2014 chat log between Adeeb and Dr Azeema Adam, the former central bank governor, who expressed misgivings but suggested it could be done with evidence showing the source of the funds and legitimacy of earnings.

103,[],2018-09-20,,"The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party has renewed allegations about a plot to launder US$1.5 billion in cash through Maldivian banks in 2015.
A preliminary report received Tuesday from forensic accounting firm KRyS Global validates previous media reports, the MDP said in a statement.
The report was based on a “forensic review and analysis of 80,890 messages (phone and encrypted messages)” taken from the phone of former vice president Ahmed Adeeb, which exposed “overwhelming evidence” that the scheme was “planned and coordinated at the most senior levels of President [Abdulla] Yameen’s government.”
It involved depositing cash in US$60 million tranches in a Bank of Maldives account under a cover story of leasing a lagoon for resort development.
The plot was featured in a corruption exposé aired by Al Jazeera in September 2016. Along with a massive scam to steal resort lease payments, the money laundering scheme with “secretive Asian businessmen” was also uncovered from Adeeb’s phones.
According to Al Jazeera’s investigation, the money was to be flown to the Maldives and transferred to a vault at the central bank under the supervision of local soldiers, after which it was to be credited to a private company account and transferred out.
“As they did so, the money would appear to be the cleanly earned profits of a tourism investment.”
The award-winning documentary showed a late-2014 chat log between Adeeb and Dr Azeema Adam, former governor of the central bank, who expressed misgivings but suggested it could be done with evidence showing the source of the funds and legitimacy of earnings.
But the central bank rejected the allegations as lacking “any credible foundation” and insisted that cash cannot be stored in the state vault without the presence and approval of senior officials from four government institutions.
The alleged scheme was “palpably untrue and cannot be substantiated,” it said.
Al Jazeera identified a Singaporean named Tan Kuan Yew as the middleman who “led the communication and helped set up the shell companies.” He was alleged to have sent reports to two Indonesian businessmen.
A fourth businessman involved in the scheme, Faidzan Hassan, told an undercover reporter that he launders money through a central bank in an unnamed Asian country.
It was never established whether the money came into the Maldives as the email and text message trail ended in March 2015. The four Asian businessmen denied any wrongdoing when contacted by Al Jazeera.
– President implicated –
According to the MDP, the report it commissioned from KRyS Global, a Cayman Islands-based asset recovery firm, found the scheme to have “all the earmarks of the primary objectives of criminals who launder money by physically transporting cash across borders.”
The party refused to share a copy of the report with the Maldives Independent. An official said the MDP has a “legal engagement with KRyS Global.”
The MDP statement included screenshots of an email and chat logs that suggest a meeting took place between Tan Kuan Yew and President Abdulla Yameen in Singapore on July 30, 2014.
With the presidential election scheduled for September 23, the money laundering allegations come on the heels of a new report from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) that implicated the president in leasing islands at discounted prices without public tender.
A special audit from 2016 revealed nearly US$80 million was embezzled from acquisition fees paid for more than 50 islands.
Yameen insisted that the scam “did not reach higher than Adeeb” and claimed he was unaware of the unprecedented theft.
Adeeb, the president’s former right-hand man, is now serving a 33-year jail sentence on multiple counts of graft and terrorism.
Last Sunday, Yameen acknowledged that he had authorised the transfer of the islands to the tourism ministry under Adeeb.
“In principle, the issue was not with the lease of islands. The issue is what happened to the proceeds. That was not known to the president,” he said.",MDP revives money laundering claims,https://maldivesindependent.com/crime-2/mdp-revives-money-laundering-claims-141341
