The long road to recovery,Redundant rehab practices and social pressure hinder recovering drug users from sustaining their sobriety,,2011-01-07 00:00:00,"Jan 7, 2011-

Five guys stood at the front of the room wearing khadas and garlands of marigolds. Each took a turn making a speech into the microphone, thanking those who helped him achieve the milestone reached today and describing the obstacles on the road to get there. The speeches were followed by cake cutting and every combination of group photos possible. This was no ordinary award ceremony, it was a one-year birthday celebration of sobriety, and all five guys had, through hard work and struggle, managed to stay off intravenous drugs for a full year.

In his speech, one of the celebrants, Rakesh (name changed), explained how after six ‘tours’ of rehab and eight years involved in treatment, his family no longer believed his desire to be clean. “One day I went home and told my mom that I was leaving tomorrow for the centre. She said to me, ‘What are you going to do at the centre? The other ones didn’t work—you’ll be back within three or four months, using drugs again.’” But today Rakesh had achieved the one-year mark of sobriety and he was extremely proud of his accomplishment. “I’m happy because earlier I wasn’t able to stay in a centre for even three or four months, but now I have been clean for a whole year. I’ve left a lot of things behind.”

The birthday celebration is a common part of sobriety programmes, most notably Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), founded in 1935 in the US, and its sister organisation, Narcotics Anonymous, which is better known in Nepal as NA. It is also a hugely important component of addiction rehabilitation programmes in Nepal, which are heavily based on the theory of the twelve steps and practices of AA and NA. The twelve steps are a set of guiding principles for addiction recovery, developed by AA, that form the basis of most rehabilitation programmes. The first and most famous step is admitting powerlessness over alcohol or drugs.

This close modelling of Nepali rehabs after programmes in the US owes to the fact that the first centre in the country, Freedom Centre, was started in 1983 by an American pastor, the late Father Thomas Gaffney, and his Nepali partner who later travelled to the US to take inspiration from other centres. Since then, however, Nepali rehabs have evolved by mixing local cultural and societal norms such as an emphasis on social hierarchy with the American rehab programme basis, which emphasises the strength of fellowship—a close group of equals sharing experiences and interests, who share a history of drug use and the desire to stop using. The rehab programme at most centres in Nepal is a three-month residential programme (a little longer than the typical 30-60 day programme in the US) where clients live full-time at the centre, followed by nine months of after-care, during which clients attend the centre during the day and return home at night. The culmination of these 12 months is the birthday celebration, after which clients are set free to employ the skills and strategies they learned during rehab to stay sober outside the centre’s walls.

As exciting as celebrating the first birthday is, it can be a difficult time for people who have spent an entire year under close supervision of a tight network of recovery influences. In an already difficult economy, jobs are scarce for recovering drug users. Unlike in the urban US, where people typically have higher levels of mobility and education, recovering drug users in Nepal usually leave the centre and return to the same house and neighbourhood they grew up in, where everybody knows their secrets and drug-using status.

Just a few days after the high of his birthday celebration, Rakesh was coming down. “I haven’t taken nashaa (intoxicants), but everything else is bad,” he said, echoing a common recovery phrase which means that aside from a fragile sobriety, nothing is going well. Rakesh explained that as he no longer attended the centre (where he had spent six days a week for almost a year) his days were now spent sleeping until 5:00 pm after which he could expect to meet other recovering friends at Basantapur, where many in recovery spend their evenings as part of a ‘recovery fellowship’.

Like many other recovering users, Rakesh struggled to find employment with his limited education and virtually no work experience. In a community where jobs are typically garnered through connections, Rakesh’s connections all knew him as a drug user and feared hiring someone with that reputation, for he may steal money to use drugs again. Another recovering user confirmed their suspicions: he had lost his job after stealing 25,000 rupees from his boss to buy drugs. Besides, the livelihood programmes aimed to counter unemployment typically amount to little more than small handicraft work like candle- making, which is unlikely to provide substantial work or income to clients once they leave the centre.

The more than 40 rehab centres in Kathmandu do not have accurate records on relapse, but all acknowledge that rates are high. This is true in the US as well where relapse rates hover around 50 percent. Sustained sobriety is difficult to achieve and many of the economic and societal pressures that push Nepali people towards drug use—such as limited education, unemployment and few work opportunities, and strained family relationships in joint households—still exist once the year of treatment has ended. While the rehab centre offers a place and time to focus on sobriety, the emphasis on concrete ways to stay clean after treatment is not as strong.

In addition to the lack of social support and employment skills, recovering drug users fall victim to a dozen redundant practices adopted from the American system. Many slogans recovering users learn and are supposed to internalise, for example, do not work in the cultural context here. One of the most popular is the ‘ABC’ or Avoid Bad Circle slogan, which instructs recovering drug users to avoid friends and the old drug-using area. For Rakesh, who cannot move out from his family’s house, and whose old using partners lives just down the street, this is virtually impossible. “Once I come home, I don’t go outside. Down the block is my using partner. I only leave if I have any work or to go to the centre,” he explained. Another client who struggled to stay clean after leaving the centre and was known in Thamel for dealing agreed, “I try to hide and walk. But still, people [other users] say, ‘Oi! Come here.’”

Another practice that is lost in translation is the reliance on English language in meetings and programmes. English phrases like ‘self-esteem’ are used without an appropriate Nepali explanation, to clients who do not speak English. Clients themselves use these phrases, often without a good understanding of their meaning. It is incredibly difficult for recovering drug users in Nepal to achieve lasting sobriety. The large number of centres, emergence of AA and NA meetings, and greater awareness of drug use in Kathmandu is a step in the right direction. But it’s time to take it a step further and focus on serious job training and employment assistance, and to choose not to use inappropriate practices adopted years ago from the US system. Societal acceptance too will go a long way in allowing recovering users to move past their drug-using identity and turn a fragile sobriety into a lasting one.

After re-entering the centre for an abbreviated treatment after his 7th relapse, Rakesh was offered a job by a relative and has been able to maintain his sobriety by focusing on work. Every day is a struggle and Rakesh recognises that his sobriety continues to be extremely fragile. But he is counting down the months until he will celebrate his one-year birthday again.

Hard-drinking Lithuania wages battle against vodka,"Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.",,2017-08-30 00:00:00,"Aug 30, 2017-

Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.

The World Health Organization ranks Lithuanians as the world’s heaviest drinkers.

WHO estimates published in May pegged average annual consumption at 18.2 litres (4.8 gallons) of pure alcohol per person in 2016, putting the small EU Baltic state ahead of Belarus, Moldova and Russia.

“Drinking on the job had been tolerated on various occasions since the Soviet era. Today, you still see alcohol at baptisms and burials,” Father Dvareckas, 37, told AFP. Rather than being social, drinking on these occasions is often excessive to the point of passing out.

Poor mental health and coping skills play a role, especially among Lithuanian men. WHO statistics from 2014 show that 16.7 percent of them abused alcohol or were dependent on it.

Largely at fault is “Lithuanian pessimism”, according to Visvaldas Legkauskas, a psychologist at Vytautas Magnus University in the central city of Kaunas.

“Life isn’t too bad here, but we have this character trait and we drown our sorrows in alcohol or we commit suicide,” he told AFP.

Dvareckas says he managed to quit drinking and get his life back thanks to a 12-step programme similar to the one used by Alcoholics Anonymous and the support of friends and family.

Wanting to pass on what he learnt, he created the free programme As Esu (“I am” in Lithuanian) in 2009, whose combination of group meetings, prayer, therapy and work opportunities help alcoholics get back on their feet.

An association created this year forged a network allowing 20 such communities to share resources. Other initiatives such as Alcoholics Anonymous are also afoot.

Burdened by the high social costs of heavy drinking, the government is taking action to curb consumption, including tax hikes and a blanket ban on alcohol advertising.

Fighting alcoholism was among the key campaign promises that gave the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union (LPGU) a surprise victory in 2016 elections. Its leader has been organising a booze-free cultural festival in his village for a decade.

Although parliament raised the tax on alcohol in March, consumption did not fall in the eurozone state of nearly three million residents.

Lawmakers then voted by a large margin in June to raise the legal drinking age to 20 from 18 and introduce a blanket ban on alcohol ads next year.

Whether these measures will work is another matter.

“Already back in 1998, Lithuania had adopted a strategy to curb consumption by 25 percent. But the reality is that it went up by 130 percent instead,” Health Minister Aurelijus Veryga told AFP.

For Father Dvareckas, the new legislation is not enough: “Why do I still have to pass the alcohol shelf at stores before reaching the one with dairy products?”

At a local store in the village of Semeliskes, located 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Vilnius, a saleswoman named Ona is sceptical.

“Prices may have gone up, but no one really cares. People will continue to buy as long as they have money, and they’ll buy five bottles instead of one to make sure they’re stocked,” she told AFP.

Many believe that to really be effective, the restrictions affecting sales must be coupled with other forms of help.

Medical treatment of alcoholics is still spotty in Lithuania, where the necessary medication is not paid for by the state, according to the national health insurance fund.

There are only five state-run alcohol rehab centres across Lithuania.

For Veryga, the health minister, it is critical “to ensure equal access to everyone concerned in the various regions”.

Our minds are structured in such a way that forbidden things hold far greater potential for satisfaction (albeit, perhaps, only psychological), than the things we are meant, and expected, to do. This fascination and desire for what is denied persists but as we grow older, we start choosing things that make sense, things that everybody says makes sense.

Of the many ‘Do-nots’ in our society are drugs. Do not do drugs. No further questions. They are bad for you. How bad? Are they worse than the other addictive substances and tendencies that society deems worthy of being ‘legal’? These questions fall by the wayside before even registering into mass consciousness.

Drugs, by definition, are substances that alter our pattern of activity—of processing thought, stimulations, everything. Some help keep us alive (in the physical sense) whereas, some by chance, create a dangerous vortex that swallows thoughts and lives whole. Thus, we separate what society terms medicine from what it calls drugs. It is the same with addiction. If it’s severe enough to mess up your social and personal life and space, it’s an addiction.

When an adolescent brain sees a skull and crossbones sign, chances are the danger and forbiddance will have them gravitating towards it. A vicious cycle can then result in a roundabout of deviant behaviour, marginalisation by society, neglect, burden, even death.

There has, throughout millennia, persisted a view of ‘drugs’ as inherently bad. That anyone who does drugs is not for society, is morally wrong. We shall call this the moral model. Once you marginalise a person from society for being morally corrupt, you start the process of dehumanising them. The treatment of those times reflected this. Confinement, punishment and even religious indoctrination were commonplace (even the Alcoholics Anonymous with its inflated success rates collected from telephone interviews, started with a dabble into the religious and later, the spiritual.)

This view has now been confined and banished to the island where bad ideas go to complain how unfair society is. We now know that drugs use is not as simple as a good/bad dichotomy. There are numerous variables that are at play, leading to substance abuse and dependence. There are numerous variables that increase one’s chances of addictive behaviour. Not all people who experiment with drugs go down its rabbit hole, and not all who go down fail to come out again. This approach to substance abuse and addiction has led to what is now the medical model. This model believes in finding out the root causes and psychopathology behind the behaviour. These could be as wide ranging as a South American shaman drinking ayahuasca to connect to mother earth and sadhus smoking ganja for a multitude of reasons to a college kid trying ‘brown sugar’ due to some misguided idea of ‘being cool’ and a professional adding a shot of vodka in their morning coffee before driving to work because he’s a bit uptight about the day’s presentation. There will always be reasons. We as psychiatrists and addiction specialists must find those reasons. In the best cases, we help find solutions and in the worst, help them live with it.

There have been and will always be drugs. It is society that has to coexist. Whether we do this by understanding addictive human behaviour and how drugs work, or by criminalising drug-related behaviour and legally or forcefully locking up people depends on us. Unfortunately, due to factors like lack of knowledge, confusion due to conflicting messages from various sources and the patient not having a say leads to many people still strongly believing this primitive idea that bad intentions and weak morals lead to drug use.

Experimentation is how human beings learn. We do things and stick with things that work. Not all people who do any particular drug become addicted to it. In fact, only 15 percent who drink alcohol will develop abuse or addiction problems. These studies have also been replicated in mice and show huge promise for the isolation of the ‘addiction gene’. There must be individual treatment plans in place for people with uniquely different problems. Experimental use, while being discouraged and managed as it should, must never be equated with the problematic use of substances. Shaming and forcing users to quit hardly seems like a long-term solution.

Prevention, of course, is the primary goal. But, how we go about that is paramount. Removing moral labels would be a good start. Current treatment methods, if they can be called that, are appallingly primitive. They need upgrading on all fronts; psychotherapeutic, pharmacotherapeutic and even the regulation of so-called rehabs. Then, there is maintenance. Unless something positive and fulfilling takes up the space previously occupied by drugs, the person will keep on going back to what they know best. There’s even a code name for people who are admitted to rehabs repeatedly.

I’ll finish with something a patient of mine told me when asked what he had achieved from his four stints at (various) rehabs: “I made a lot of damn good contacts, doc!”

heads and tales,"Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’",,2013-05-10 00:00:00,"May 10, 2013-

The Amrikis have Superman, Spider Man, Batman and Iron Man and, of course, many other ‘-mans’. But they are all just a bunch of fictional superheroes. Tony Stark is a billionaire and uses his powered suit of armour to protect the world as Iron Man.

We too have our own ‘Nepali’ billionaire in the Forbes list and he is real, alive and kicking just like you and me. Let us all hope that Binod dai will find ways to use his wealth to help the poor and the needy. He could follow the Warren Buffet formula and give most of his wealth to charity after he is gone and leave some pocket money for his kids. The chump change would still be enough for his kids to live a privileged life.

If he can come up with a fancy costume then he can be a superhero as well. The difficult part is finding the right name when he dons a costume. He could be the ‘Wai Wai Man’, who helps hungry folks with a free packet of Wai Wai. But eating only instant noodles will not make us healthy. Maybe Binod dai should invest in them apple farms in Jomson and we could get a free apple for every packet of Wai Wai we buy. At least them apples might compensate for a high sodium and low-fibre diet.

Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’. Our beloved president has appointed him to head one of the most incompetent government bodies in Nepal—the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Well, we still have yet to find an efficient government agency. That would be like trying to find dinosaur footprints in the middle of Ratnapark.

The CIAA has yet to find any politicians guilty of corruption. Well, a few former ministers went to prison and all they got was a year and half in Dillibazar Prison. The CIAA found our former IGPs guilty in the ‘Sudan APC Scam’ but what about our former home ministers and other political leaders who probably made some dough as well?

Superhero Lokman was the chief secretary during Gyanu Uncle’s direct rule. Does that make him an evil monster? No! He was just doing his job. After all, one cannot go far up the ladder if one does not kiss them arses. According to our media wallahs, the Maoists & Madhesis (M&Ms) wanted Lokman while the Nepali Kangaroos and the Unidentified Moronic Losers were pressured to support his appointment. Our clowns talk about foreign pressure every time they can’t agree on something.

Maybe our clowns wanted Lokman so that he would spend his days reading newspapers and drinking doodh chiya. If they left Lokman alone, then he’d do everything in his power to prevent any investigation of abuse of authority by our ‘new age’ clowns.

Or is it the other way around? It takes a crook to catch a crook. So far, our clowns have been running around town, shouting ‘catch me if you can’ and we have yet to find anyone from the days of the Shree Tins who are guilty of anything…till now.

So the CIAA should just shut down its offices and open a counselling centre for Amriki spies. It could be a ‘CIA Anonymous’ like the Alcoholics Anonymous. All CIA wallahs who have problems can visit and get some counselling from the CIAA. What could we teach them kuireys? Nothing, really, but our clowns can ask them to give us suitcases full of dollars like the ones Hamid Karzai receives.

When the bidhesis throw a tantrum, our clowns will do anything to pacify them. When we Nepalis throw a tantrum, they send the Nepal Police to show us their skills in laathi-charging! The bideshis threaten to cut down them foreign aid if they are not happy with our buffoons. And if there is no aid then there won’t be much room left for commissions.

No wonder, then, that a kuire can walk around town at two in the morning and the police will ignore him because they don’t want to waste their time learning English 101. If it’s a Nepali, then the police wallah will suddenly have enough questions to turn the investigation into some kind of a session with Sigmund Freud. We have yet to let go of that ‘white man—must be a rich man’ natak!

Our student unions want the government to send Lokman home. The smaller fishes want the president to resign. Leave Lord Rama alone. If Lokman can come back then why not bring Lord Vishnu as well? At least Gyanu Uncle can be the chief guest for all them jatras in the Valley.

Our student unions should gherao the Foreign Ministry and demand that Dorje Gurung, a former teacher at Qatar Academy, is freed from a Doha jail so he can come home and go trekking, rafting or even paragliding.

New alcohol control law in the offing,"The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.",,2018-11-22 00:00:00,"Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to shops

Nov 22, 2018-

The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.

Sources at the Home Ministry said that the draft of a new regulation on alcoholic beverage control is expected to be tabled at the Cabinet for approval next week.

Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to liquor shops.

“We think the alcohol business has gone rampant and liquor shops have been creating new drinkers. It has been increasing crime and rape cases,” said a high-level source at the ministry, who wished to remain anonymous.

This is not the first time. Two years ago, the government had enforced the National Policy on Regulation and Control of Alcohol 2017, barring a pictorial warning that depicts liver cirrhosis and effects on other organs, covering at least 75 percent of the bottle. Under the rules, a statutory warning “Drinking is injurious to health” should be prominently displayed on the bottle. The law also bars people under the age of 21 years and pregnant women from purchasing alcoholic drinks and government institutions from hosting events with alcoholic beverages. The rules also bar displaying advertisement in print or other digital media.

It has also listed restricted areas for sales, including public places, schools and colleges, religious and other historical sites. “But, the rules have not been implemented,” said the official. “So, we decided to introduce regulatory measures this time.”

The new regulation will allow up to five liquor shops in a single ward, he said.

Officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, which issues the alcoholic beverage licence, said that a few weeks ago, the Home Ministry had consulted with them on the draft.

“We also suggested enforcing effective regulations without hampering the existing manufacturing companies,” said officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.

According to the Federation of Liquor Associations of Nepal, 57 distilleries and nine breweries have received operating licences as of now.

Santosh Pandey, past president of the federation, however criticised the government’s move. He said that if the new law is endorsed, it will give rise to cartel in the liquor firms as there won’t be market competition at all. “The ban is not rational.”

According to the Health Ministry, at least 17.8 percent of the total population has a habit of drinking on a daily basis, while around 2 percent consume alcohol in harmful ways. A survey conducted in 2013 by the Nepal Health Research Council showed men were more likely to drink.

In Praise of Disregard,"Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments,",,2014-03-20 00:00:00,"Mar 20, 2014-

Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments, I spend many hours reading about the issues; but I have a tendency to dwell on stories I find truly distressing, such as tales of leaked videos showing the blunt discrepancy between a politician's on- and off-screen selves. I am drawn to the most hopeless headlines, the reports that make humans seem like wolves, the kind that make it impossible to stifle my expletives. I feel it physiologically: My adrenaline surges, my breaths get quick and short, and I pace and fume around the apartment trying to get rid of this nervous energy.

It doesn't matter what your political position is; reading or watching things that aggressively dispute all that you believe can produce this effect. Often, my whole afternoon is wrecked by reading one article or watching one debate. And that lost afternoon is irretrievable. Those hours I could have spent pursuing my research, or engaging creatively in something, or writing an article like this one, which demonstrates some faith in humanity, are lost because of a morbid attraction to provocative rhetoric and lost causes. But if a pundit screams brutishly in the forest and there is no one there to hear him, does he still make a sound?

Reality and the voices that claim to represent reality are not at all the same thing. And even if they were, given the abundance of problems that we are told each day need immediate attention, there is a certain threshold beyond which an individual cannot affect the universe. No amount of outrage can repair certain broken features of our politics, like the boundless partisanship and the punitive and reactionary attitudes displayed throughout Congress, whose forte is clearly not equanimity.

“Don't protest against what you disapprove. Do without it.” The Italian philosopher and mystic Lanza del Vasto gave this compelling advice in his 1945 book “Principles and Precepts of the Return to the Obvious.” His counsel, offered at the dusk of the Second World War in response to its barbarity, could be of service to us now, in our politically contentious culture where the realities of the information age bring us into contact each day with opinions that displease us.

In the past, it was easier to avoid what you didn't need to hear. Today, it requires a concerted effort to do so, and it still isn't possible to sidestep troubling views altogether. In addition, most public speech can now be commented on, and often is, thanks to the web. Recent years have confirmed that when things can be commented on, especially anonymously, people often become the worst versions of themselves. The opinions of others washing over us is the inescapable state of things today.

But it is possible to subdue those ideas that do violence to us. Ideas are given credence only when they are entertained. By disregarding them, we can erode much of their influence.

Disregard is sometimes negatively connoted in English. I do not suggest we should disregard other people or deny them respect. Nor am I advocating willful ignorance; putting on blinders to avoid what annoys us is not a solution, just an evasion tactic. What is problematic about the blinders metaphor is that it requires you to block out everything in your peripheral vision in order to stay focused on the task at hand, which means you might miss something beautiful or consequential. While it is unwise to shut your ears to opinions that differ from yours, it is equally unwise to let these opinions (particularly in their sensationalized iterations) carry you to total despair. I argue, rather, for a careful selection of what is injurious to you and an excision of it from your life and thought.

What I propose involves three steps: (1) a taking into account all positions, a kind of survey of possible ways to look at things, even those ways we find irritating; (2) identifying those ideas that degrade us and sap our energies; and (3) denying these ideas an existence in our personal spheres.

It is important to be sure that the ideas you want to eliminate from existence aren't those that would have spurred you to action in your actual life. For example, if getting angry about the retrogression of women's rights or about the increasing margin between rich and poor could impel you to get involved in your community to change these things, then, by all means, let the negative feelings fuel you. But many of the ideas we encounter, especially when rehashed in ever more amplified ways, serve only to distract us from the real issues. In a gesture of good faith and honesty with yourself, identify what you know you will never actually do anything about and eliminate it from your field of thought.

Imagine, for example, that you receive an angry email from someone and there is nothing you can do about the person's grievances. You read it. You accept your inability to change the situation. Then you delete it. Instead of leaving it in your inbox to pull your thoughts toward an irrevocable past, the symbolic act of throwing it away frees your mental energies for more worthwhile pursuits. This is a metaphor, of course. It is probably quite easy for you to delete an email that bothers your brain. But thoughts, which are as virtual as email, can be gotten rid of as well. In all their immateriality, thoughts and emails still impose an extraordinary amount of authority and influence on our actions and frames of mind. Doing away with them has the same effect as removing a concrete obstacle from sidewalk ahead of you.

The spirit of disregard I describe resembles the early Greek notions of apatheia and ataraxia, as well as the Serenity Prayer, invoked by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” But the distinction is that the method of disregard I've outlined asks for a systematic identification of the very specific things that take away your energy and an active effort to undo them. Rather than a simple and passive acceptance of the things you cannot control, I favor an acceptance and then a subsequent, symbolic deletion of those things.

I propose this method of disregard as a path to simmering down collectively. Regardless if you're on the left or on the right or anywhere in between, you've surely noticed how worked up we've become. There are obvious pressing issues at hand to be dealt with, but this helpless frenzy keeps us in a cycle of pointless trolling and political implosion. Getting flustered breathes life into other people's fictions. When your buttons have been pushed and your goat gotten, it is rare that you can act with composure in response. Instead, you react. Action derives from power, reaction from a state of powerlessness. While anger can be a catalyst for political action, it seems that much of the anger generated by mediatized political debates is never actually channeled toward fixing things. It is either pent up, leading to sullenness and self-devastation, or redirected toward others in destructive ways.

Finally, adopting a policy of disregard could be positive if for no other reason than one's own mental state of health. By doing away with the negativity and heaviness brought about by dwelling on toxic ideas, the blood pressure lowers, the muscles slacken, the jaw unclenches. The body undoubtedly enjoys respite every now and then from the assaults of such a charged environment.

In the climactic scene of the 1986 fantasy movie “Labyrinth,” as the protagonist faces off with the Goblin King, who had tried to control her, she declares with clear-eyed composure: “You have no power over me.” This simple declaration causes the Goblin King's supremacy to collapse, his kingdom to dissipate. By declaring that what disturbs you has no power over you, by disregarding its influence and “doing without it,” as Lanza del Vasto advises, you recover some of your vitality and self-possession.

So redirect time and efforts wasted on adversaries toward friends. Accrue your energies for better things. Dismiss what damages you.

Angelina Jolie questioned by FBI,Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.,,2016-10-27 00:00:00,"Oct 27, 2016-

Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.

Pitt is alleged to have gotten ""verbally abusive"" and ""physical"" with their son Maddox, 15, while under the influence of alcohol during a flight on September 14 and Jolie filed for divorce just days later.

After an anonymous source reported the alleged incident, the FBI got involved as they have jurisdiction because the incident occurred in mid-air.

""The agents wanted a breakdown of everything that happened from when the plane took off to when it landed. Angelina fully cooperated,"" a source told usmagazine.com.

The source added that the FBI ""will likely investigate for another few weeks"". After that they ""will present the case to the prosecutor, who will evaluate whether they feel the need to bring charges. It could potentially be months"".

Yet both Pitt and Jolie are eager to avoid a court case, with the source explaining: ""Neither side wants this to go to court because everything the FBI and DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) investigated will potentially be made available to the public, which would be bad for the entire family.""

It was later reported that ""Maddox suffered no injuries and some witnesses on the jet say Brad's contact with the boy was inadvertent"".

Meanwhile, it has been reported that DCFS have extended their investigation into Pitt.

The two and their children -- Maddox, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- have all been previously interviewed. The DCFS has now expanded its investigation to other alleged incidents.

Jolie and Pitt have agreed on a parenting plan, giving the actress temporary physical custody over the children with Pitt allowed to visit them under the supervision of a therapist.

Jul 19, 2016-In Nepal, long-term thinking is always seen as a formality. The concept of long-term planning has never been embedded in our thinking, although culturally, we participate in many rituals and deeds that look beyond the present time to our afterlife. And this continues to be the paradox: People who perform rituals to “fix” their afterlife and ensure that their children continue them for the same purpose fail to focus on long-term planning for themselves, their family or their organisations. Many ‘poverty specialists’ attribute this phenomenon—where people are only focused on their day-to-day living and are unable to think beyond two square meals—to extreme poverty and a series of famines in earlier centuries. But perhaps, Nepal has come a long way as indicated by our achievements of Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Sailesh Tiwari, who authored a World Bank report titled ‘Moving up the ladder: poverty reduction and social mobility in Nepal’, explains how Nepal has been able to reduce poverty in a time span comparable with countries like China. It is important for Nepal to prepare for the future and set some long-term goals.

Dependency syndrome

Culturally, the dependency syndrome that prevails in developing society like ours, fueled by the presence of free money, creates complications when it comes to vision for the future. In many Nepali families, a young man waits to furnish his room from the dowry he will receive. In villages, people who buy motorcycles, smartphones and lots of alcohol with their own money, wait for the assistance of some government body or NGO to build a toilet in their house. College kids rely on donations from companies and organisations to finance their fun-filled excursions, and political parties rely on anonymous funds, usually with strings attached, to help them run for elections. Banks with over half a billion of market capitalisation wait for some donor to subsidise the opening of a branch or the organisation of a programme. Dependency, in contrast to internal will, is one of the biggest impediments to making long-term plans. Dependency kills innovation, which is a key ingredient to envision the future.

Growth and investments

For Nepal to graduate to a middle-income country by 2030, when the country’s population will be around 36 million, it needs a $100 billion dollar economy with a per capita income of $2,500. To reach this mark, we need over eight percent growth each year. Economic growth can only occur if there are investments in infrastructure, entrepreneurship development and employment generation. This would require an investment of about $7 to 8 billion each year. Domestic investment capacities do not exceed $2 billion a year at present, which means we need foreign investment. Now if we are to attract foreign investment, we need a whole set of reforms that will enable us to compete with other nations. For many years, Nepal has been a country that receives one of the lowest foreign investments in the world. The inward looking Nepali society and businesses run by protectionist cartels and syndicates are keeping foreign investors at bay. We need to open up. What is the point of having a stock market with $15 billion market capitalisation when neither foreign investors are permitted to invest in it nor international players are allowed to recalibrate the market with an injection of contemporary technology and services? Cocooning ourselves from the outside world and finding newer protectionists strategies in the name of nationalism will continue to ail the country’s economy, a problem of over 200 years.

Certain milestones excite people globally. In the past, the turn of the century was

a big one; 2020 is considered another big milestone that pushed countries like Malaysia to conquer poverty and unleash economic potential. There are many countries that have been able to grow at a fast pace in last two to three decades. Landlocked Ethopia, for example, increased its GDP four times from $16 billion to $60 billion in ten years. Rwanda, during the same time period, grew three times. Nepal, however, could only double its GDP in that period. Countries like Ivory Coast that were written off are on the march to attract billions of dollars in foreign investments to unleash economic growth.

Formal and informal

Given the performances of countries similar to Nepal, it is not impossible for us to grow to become a $100 billion economy and

graduate to a middle-income country by 2030. For this, a big part of the

informal economy of the country needs to be converted into the formal economy by acquiring reliable statistics and expanding the taxation net. A large chunk of our economy is informal, which is very common in countries like ours, but it needs to graduate to formal economy at a quicker pace.

The six months of black marketeering pushed many formal sectors into the

fold of the informal, and the tendency to cheat the state and the consumers never ceases. Embracing global practices, facilitating tax payment, making government accountable and getting rid of a dependency mindset will all help us to convert a bigger part of the informal economy into the formal economy.

"Gunman kills nine at Oregon college, dies in shootout with police","A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death.",,2015-10-02 00:00:00,"People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon on Thursday.

Oct 2, 2015-

A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death, authorities said, in yet another burst of U.S. gun violence that ranked as the deadliest this year.

The suspect, who witnesses say fired dozens of shots into a classroom full of screaming students, was slain in an exchange of gunfire with two police officers in Snyder Hall at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg following the morning rampage.

He was not publicly identified by local authorities - the county sheriff vowed never to utter his name. But CBS, CNN, NBC and the New York Times named him as 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer, citing anonymous law enforcement sources.

""He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,"" the Times quoted one law enforcement official as saying.

CNN reported that three handguns and a ""long gun"" belonging to him were recovered from the scene. According to published eyewitness accounts, the gunman at one point ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before spraying the classroom with bullets.

""The law enforcement investigation into the shooter and his motivations is continuing,"" Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters at an afternoon news conference.

He also said three of the wounded victims were hospitalized in critical condition.

The massacre in Roseburg, a former timber town on the western edge of the Cascades some 260 miles (418 km) south of Portland, was the latest in a flurry of deadly mass shootings at American college and public school campuses, movie theaters, military bases and churches in recent years.

The 10 people killed surpassed the death tolls from two previous mass shootings - a gun battle between rival motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the rampage of a gunman at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, each of which claimed nine lives - to mark the deadliest incident of gun violence in the United States this year.

Not counting Thursday's carnage, a total of 293 mass shootings have been reported since January 2015, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that defines a mass shooting as any event in which four or more people are shot.

The killings have fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and better care for the mentally ill.

President Barack Obama, speaking just hours after the rampage, said the mass killing should move Americans to demand greater gun controls from elected officials.

""Somehow this has become routine,"" a visibly angry Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine. ...We’ve become numb to this.""

GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS

Kortney Moore, 18, told the local News Review newspaper that she was in her writing class in Snyder Hall when a gunshot came through the window and struck her teacher in the head.

Inside the classroom, Moore said, the gunman told people to get on the ground, then asked them to stand up and state their religion before he started shooting.

Freshman Kenny Ungerman told NBC that said he saw the shooter, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying a handgun as he went into the building, followed by gunshots and screams. Student Cassandra Welding told CNN that she heard 35 to 40 shots.

Student Brady Winder, in a posting on Facebook, said he was in a classroom next door to the room where the shooting began and ran, along with his classmates, when they heard the gunfire.

""I ran to the edge of the campus, down a hill and waited. From talking with a student in the classroom where it happen, almost every person in the room was shot by a man with four guns,"" Winder, 23, wrote.

PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center emergency room doctor Hans Notenboom told reporters three women about 18 to 34 years of age were flown to the hospital in Riverbend by helicopter, and two were moved directly into operating room.

Survivors were transported to a local fairgrounds, and some family members were left waiting for hours to see if their loved ones would be among them.

""We have grief counselors waiting for those parents who have no children getting off that bus,"" said the college's president, Rita Calvin.

Following the bloodshed state and federal authorities swarmed Roseburg, including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Police descended on an apartment possibly linked to the suspect about 2 miles (3 km) from campus, where police tape prevented access. It was not immediately clear who lived in the residence.

The college, which began its fall term this week and serves more than 13,000 students - 3,000 of them full time - said it would be closed until Monday. Hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil at nightfall.

In 2012, seven students at the small Christian college Oikos University in Oakland, California, were shot dead by a former student, marking the deadliest outburst of violence at a U.S. college since April 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech University killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before taking his own life.

The long road to recovery,Redundant rehab practices and social pressure hinder recovering drug users from sustaining their sobriety,,2011-01-07 00:00:00,"Jan 7, 2011-

Five guys stood at the front of the room wearing khadas and garlands of marigolds. Each took a turn making a speech into the microphone, thanking those who helped him achieve the milestone reached today and describing the obstacles on the road to get there. The speeches were followed by cake cutting and every combination of group photos possible. This was no ordinary award ceremony, it was a one-year birthday celebration of sobriety, and all five guys had, through hard work and struggle, managed to stay off intravenous drugs for a full year.

In his speech, one of the celebrants, Rakesh (name changed), explained how after six ‘tours’ of rehab and eight years involved in treatment, his family no longer believed his desire to be clean. “One day I went home and told my mom that I was leaving tomorrow for the centre. She said to me, ‘What are you going to do at the centre? The other ones didn’t work—you’ll be back within three or four months, using drugs again.’” But today Rakesh had achieved the one-year mark of sobriety and he was extremely proud of his accomplishment. “I’m happy because earlier I wasn’t able to stay in a centre for even three or four months, but now I have been clean for a whole year. I’ve left a lot of things behind.”

The birthday celebration is a common part of sobriety programmes, most notably Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), founded in 1935 in the US, and its sister organisation, Narcotics Anonymous, which is better known in Nepal as NA. It is also a hugely important component of addiction rehabilitation programmes in Nepal, which are heavily based on the theory of the twelve steps and practices of AA and NA. The twelve steps are a set of guiding principles for addiction recovery, developed by AA, that form the basis of most rehabilitation programmes. The first and most famous step is admitting powerlessness over alcohol or drugs.

This close modelling of Nepali rehabs after programmes in the US owes to the fact that the first centre in the country, Freedom Centre, was started in 1983 by an American pastor, the late Father Thomas Gaffney, and his Nepali partner who later travelled to the US to take inspiration from other centres. Since then, however, Nepali rehabs have evolved by mixing local cultural and societal norms such as an emphasis on social hierarchy with the American rehab programme basis, which emphasises the strength of fellowship—a close group of equals sharing experiences and interests, who share a history of drug use and the desire to stop using. The rehab programme at most centres in Nepal is a three-month residential programme (a little longer than the typical 30-60 day programme in the US) where clients live full-time at the centre, followed by nine months of after-care, during which clients attend the centre during the day and return home at night. The culmination of these 12 months is the birthday celebration, after which clients are set free to employ the skills and strategies they learned during rehab to stay sober outside the centre’s walls.

As exciting as celebrating the first birthday is, it can be a difficult time for people who have spent an entire year under close supervision of a tight network of recovery influences. In an already difficult economy, jobs are scarce for recovering drug users. Unlike in the urban US, where people typically have higher levels of mobility and education, recovering drug users in Nepal usually leave the centre and return to the same house and neighbourhood they grew up in, where everybody knows their secrets and drug-using status.

Just a few days after the high of his birthday celebration, Rakesh was coming down. “I haven’t taken nashaa (intoxicants), but everything else is bad,” he said, echoing a common recovery phrase which means that aside from a fragile sobriety, nothing is going well. Rakesh explained that as he no longer attended the centre (where he had spent six days a week for almost a year) his days were now spent sleeping until 5:00 pm after which he could expect to meet other recovering friends at Basantapur, where many in recovery spend their evenings as part of a ‘recovery fellowship’.

Like many other recovering users, Rakesh struggled to find employment with his limited education and virtually no work experience. In a community where jobs are typically garnered through connections, Rakesh’s connections all knew him as a drug user and feared hiring someone with that reputation, for he may steal money to use drugs again. Another recovering user confirmed their suspicions: he had lost his job after stealing 25,000 rupees from his boss to buy drugs. Besides, the livelihood programmes aimed to counter unemployment typically amount to little more than small handicraft work like candle- making, which is unlikely to provide substantial work or income to clients once they leave the centre.

The more than 40 rehab centres in Kathmandu do not have accurate records on relapse, but all acknowledge that rates are high. This is true in the US as well where relapse rates hover around 50 percent. Sustained sobriety is difficult to achieve and many of the economic and societal pressures that push Nepali people towards drug use—such as limited education, unemployment and few work opportunities, and strained family relationships in joint households—still exist once the year of treatment has ended. While the rehab centre offers a place and time to focus on sobriety, the emphasis on concrete ways to stay clean after treatment is not as strong.

In addition to the lack of social support and employment skills, recovering drug users fall victim to a dozen redundant practices adopted from the American system. Many slogans recovering users learn and are supposed to internalise, for example, do not work in the cultural context here. One of the most popular is the ‘ABC’ or Avoid Bad Circle slogan, which instructs recovering drug users to avoid friends and the old drug-using area. For Rakesh, who cannot move out from his family’s house, and whose old using partners lives just down the street, this is virtually impossible. “Once I come home, I don’t go outside. Down the block is my using partner. I only leave if I have any work or to go to the centre,” he explained. Another client who struggled to stay clean after leaving the centre and was known in Thamel for dealing agreed, “I try to hide and walk. But still, people [other users] say, ‘Oi! Come here.’”

Another practice that is lost in translation is the reliance on English language in meetings and programmes. English phrases like ‘self-esteem’ are used without an appropriate Nepali explanation, to clients who do not speak English. Clients themselves use these phrases, often without a good understanding of their meaning. It is incredibly difficult for recovering drug users in Nepal to achieve lasting sobriety. The large number of centres, emergence of AA and NA meetings, and greater awareness of drug use in Kathmandu is a step in the right direction. But it’s time to take it a step further and focus on serious job training and employment assistance, and to choose not to use inappropriate practices adopted years ago from the US system. Societal acceptance too will go a long way in allowing recovering users to move past their drug-using identity and turn a fragile sobriety into a lasting one.

After re-entering the centre for an abbreviated treatment after his 7th relapse, Rakesh was offered a job by a relative and has been able to maintain his sobriety by focusing on work. Every day is a struggle and Rakesh recognises that his sobriety continues to be extremely fragile. But he is counting down the months until he will celebrate his one-year birthday again.

Hard-drinking Lithuania wages battle against vodka,"Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.",,2017-08-30 00:00:00,"Aug 30, 2017-

Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.

The World Health Organization ranks Lithuanians as the world’s heaviest drinkers.

WHO estimates published in May pegged average annual consumption at 18.2 litres (4.8 gallons) of pure alcohol per person in 2016, putting the small EU Baltic state ahead of Belarus, Moldova and Russia.

“Drinking on the job had been tolerated on various occasions since the Soviet era. Today, you still see alcohol at baptisms and burials,” Father Dvareckas, 37, told AFP. Rather than being social, drinking on these occasions is often excessive to the point of passing out.

Poor mental health and coping skills play a role, especially among Lithuanian men. WHO statistics from 2014 show that 16.7 percent of them abused alcohol or were dependent on it.

Largely at fault is “Lithuanian pessimism”, according to Visvaldas Legkauskas, a psychologist at Vytautas Magnus University in the central city of Kaunas.

“Life isn’t too bad here, but we have this character trait and we drown our sorrows in alcohol or we commit suicide,” he told AFP.

Dvareckas says he managed to quit drinking and get his life back thanks to a 12-step programme similar to the one used by Alcoholics Anonymous and the support of friends and family.

Wanting to pass on what he learnt, he created the free programme As Esu (“I am” in Lithuanian) in 2009, whose combination of group meetings, prayer, therapy and work opportunities help alcoholics get back on their feet.

An association created this year forged a network allowing 20 such communities to share resources. Other initiatives such as Alcoholics Anonymous are also afoot.

Burdened by the high social costs of heavy drinking, the government is taking action to curb consumption, including tax hikes and a blanket ban on alcohol advertising.

Fighting alcoholism was among the key campaign promises that gave the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union (LPGU) a surprise victory in 2016 elections. Its leader has been organising a booze-free cultural festival in his village for a decade.

Although parliament raised the tax on alcohol in March, consumption did not fall in the eurozone state of nearly three million residents.

Lawmakers then voted by a large margin in June to raise the legal drinking age to 20 from 18 and introduce a blanket ban on alcohol ads next year.

Whether these measures will work is another matter.

“Already back in 1998, Lithuania had adopted a strategy to curb consumption by 25 percent. But the reality is that it went up by 130 percent instead,” Health Minister Aurelijus Veryga told AFP.

For Father Dvareckas, the new legislation is not enough: “Why do I still have to pass the alcohol shelf at stores before reaching the one with dairy products?”

At a local store in the village of Semeliskes, located 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Vilnius, a saleswoman named Ona is sceptical.

“Prices may have gone up, but no one really cares. People will continue to buy as long as they have money, and they’ll buy five bottles instead of one to make sure they’re stocked,” she told AFP.

Many believe that to really be effective, the restrictions affecting sales must be coupled with other forms of help.

Medical treatment of alcoholics is still spotty in Lithuania, where the necessary medication is not paid for by the state, according to the national health insurance fund.

There are only five state-run alcohol rehab centres across Lithuania.

For Veryga, the health minister, it is critical “to ensure equal access to everyone concerned in the various regions”.

Our minds are structured in such a way that forbidden things hold far greater potential for satisfaction (albeit, perhaps, only psychological), than the things we are meant, and expected, to do. This fascination and desire for what is denied persists but as we grow older, we start choosing things that make sense, things that everybody says makes sense.

Of the many ‘Do-nots’ in our society are drugs. Do not do drugs. No further questions. They are bad for you. How bad? Are they worse than the other addictive substances and tendencies that society deems worthy of being ‘legal’? These questions fall by the wayside before even registering into mass consciousness.

Drugs, by definition, are substances that alter our pattern of activity—of processing thought, stimulations, everything. Some help keep us alive (in the physical sense) whereas, some by chance, create a dangerous vortex that swallows thoughts and lives whole. Thus, we separate what society terms medicine from what it calls drugs. It is the same with addiction. If it’s severe enough to mess up your social and personal life and space, it’s an addiction.

When an adolescent brain sees a skull and crossbones sign, chances are the danger and forbiddance will have them gravitating towards it. A vicious cycle can then result in a roundabout of deviant behaviour, marginalisation by society, neglect, burden, even death.

There has, throughout millennia, persisted a view of ‘drugs’ as inherently bad. That anyone who does drugs is not for society, is morally wrong. We shall call this the moral model. Once you marginalise a person from society for being morally corrupt, you start the process of dehumanising them. The treatment of those times reflected this. Confinement, punishment and even religious indoctrination were commonplace (even the Alcoholics Anonymous with its inflated success rates collected from telephone interviews, started with a dabble into the religious and later, the spiritual.)

This view has now been confined and banished to the island where bad ideas go to complain how unfair society is. We now know that drugs use is not as simple as a good/bad dichotomy. There are numerous variables that are at play, leading to substance abuse and dependence. There are numerous variables that increase one’s chances of addictive behaviour. Not all people who experiment with drugs go down its rabbit hole, and not all who go down fail to come out again. This approach to substance abuse and addiction has led to what is now the medical model. This model believes in finding out the root causes and psychopathology behind the behaviour. These could be as wide ranging as a South American shaman drinking ayahuasca to connect to mother earth and sadhus smoking ganja for a multitude of reasons to a college kid trying ‘brown sugar’ due to some misguided idea of ‘being cool’ and a professional adding a shot of vodka in their morning coffee before driving to work because he’s a bit uptight about the day’s presentation. There will always be reasons. We as psychiatrists and addiction specialists must find those reasons. In the best cases, we help find solutions and in the worst, help them live with it.

There have been and will always be drugs. It is society that has to coexist. Whether we do this by understanding addictive human behaviour and how drugs work, or by criminalising drug-related behaviour and legally or forcefully locking up people depends on us. Unfortunately, due to factors like lack of knowledge, confusion due to conflicting messages from various sources and the patient not having a say leads to many people still strongly believing this primitive idea that bad intentions and weak morals lead to drug use.

Experimentation is how human beings learn. We do things and stick with things that work. Not all people who do any particular drug become addicted to it. In fact, only 15 percent who drink alcohol will develop abuse or addiction problems. These studies have also been replicated in mice and show huge promise for the isolation of the ‘addiction gene’. There must be individual treatment plans in place for people with uniquely different problems. Experimental use, while being discouraged and managed as it should, must never be equated with the problematic use of substances. Shaming and forcing users to quit hardly seems like a long-term solution.

Prevention, of course, is the primary goal. But, how we go about that is paramount. Removing moral labels would be a good start. Current treatment methods, if they can be called that, are appallingly primitive. They need upgrading on all fronts; psychotherapeutic, pharmacotherapeutic and even the regulation of so-called rehabs. Then, there is maintenance. Unless something positive and fulfilling takes up the space previously occupied by drugs, the person will keep on going back to what they know best. There’s even a code name for people who are admitted to rehabs repeatedly.

I’ll finish with something a patient of mine told me when asked what he had achieved from his four stints at (various) rehabs: “I made a lot of damn good contacts, doc!”

Drugs, by definition, are substances that alter our pattern of activity—of processing thought, stimulations, everything.
A vicious cycle can then result in a roundabout of deviant behaviour, marginalisation by society, neglect, burden, even death.

heads and tales,"Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’",,2013-05-10 00:00:00,"May 10, 2013-

The Amrikis have Superman, Spider Man, Batman and Iron Man and, of course, many other ‘-mans’. But they are all just a bunch of fictional superheroes. Tony Stark is a billionaire and uses his powered suit of armour to protect the world as Iron Man.

We too have our own ‘Nepali’ billionaire in the Forbes list and he is real, alive and kicking just like you and me. Let us all hope that Binod dai will find ways to use his wealth to help the poor and the needy. He could follow the Warren Buffet formula and give most of his wealth to charity after he is gone and leave some pocket money for his kids. The chump change would still be enough for his kids to live a privileged life.

If he can come up with a fancy costume then he can be a superhero as well. The difficult part is finding the right name when he dons a costume. He could be the ‘Wai Wai Man’, who helps hungry folks with a free packet of Wai Wai. But eating only instant noodles will not make us healthy. Maybe Binod dai should invest in them apple farms in Jomson and we could get a free apple for every packet of Wai Wai we buy. At least them apples might compensate for a high sodium and low-fibre diet.

Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’. Our beloved president has appointed him to head one of the most incompetent government bodies in Nepal—the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Well, we still have yet to find an efficient government agency. That would be like trying to find dinosaur footprints in the middle of Ratnapark.

The CIAA has yet to find any politicians guilty of corruption. Well, a few former ministers went to prison and all they got was a year and half in Dillibazar Prison. The CIAA found our former IGPs guilty in the ‘Sudan APC Scam’ but what about our former home ministers and other political leaders who probably made some dough as well?

Superhero Lokman was the chief secretary during Gyanu Uncle’s direct rule. Does that make him an evil monster? No! He was just doing his job. After all, one cannot go far up the ladder if one does not kiss them arses. According to our media wallahs, the Maoists & Madhesis (M&Ms) wanted Lokman while the Nepali Kangaroos and the Unidentified Moronic Losers were pressured to support his appointment. Our clowns talk about foreign pressure every time they can’t agree on something.

Maybe our clowns wanted Lokman so that he would spend his days reading newspapers and drinking doodh chiya. If they left Lokman alone, then he’d do everything in his power to prevent any investigation of abuse of authority by our ‘new age’ clowns.

Or is it the other way around? It takes a crook to catch a crook. So far, our clowns have been running around town, shouting ‘catch me if you can’ and we have yet to find anyone from the days of the Shree Tins who are guilty of anything…till now.

So the CIAA should just shut down its offices and open a counselling centre for Amriki spies. It could be a ‘CIA Anonymous’ like the Alcoholics Anonymous. All CIA wallahs who have problems can visit and get some counselling from the CIAA. What could we teach them kuireys? Nothing, really, but our clowns can ask them to give us suitcases full of dollars like the ones Hamid Karzai receives.

When the bidhesis throw a tantrum, our clowns will do anything to pacify them. When we Nepalis throw a tantrum, they send the Nepal Police to show us their skills in laathi-charging! The bideshis threaten to cut down them foreign aid if they are not happy with our buffoons. And if there is no aid then there won’t be much room left for commissions.

No wonder, then, that a kuire can walk around town at two in the morning and the police will ignore him because they don’t want to waste their time learning English 101. If it’s a Nepali, then the police wallah will suddenly have enough questions to turn the investigation into some kind of a session with Sigmund Freud. We have yet to let go of that ‘white man—must be a rich man’ natak!

Our student unions want the government to send Lokman home. The smaller fishes want the president to resign. Leave Lord Rama alone. If Lokman can come back then why not bring Lord Vishnu as well? At least Gyanu Uncle can be the chief guest for all them jatras in the Valley.

Our student unions should gherao the Foreign Ministry and demand that Dorje Gurung, a former teacher at Qatar Academy, is freed from a Doha jail so he can come home and go trekking, rafting or even paragliding.

New alcohol control law in the offing,"The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.",,2018-11-22 00:00:00,"Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to shops

Nov 22, 2018-

The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.

Sources at the Home Ministry said that the draft of a new regulation on alcoholic beverage control is expected to be tabled at the Cabinet for approval next week.

Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to liquor shops.

“We think the alcohol business has gone rampant and liquor shops have been creating new drinkers. It has been increasing crime and rape cases,” said a high-level source at the ministry, who wished to remain anonymous.

This is not the first time. Two years ago, the government had enforced the National Policy on Regulation and Control of Alcohol 2017, barring a pictorial warning that depicts liver cirrhosis and effects on other organs, covering at least 75 percent of the bottle. Under the rules, a statutory warning “Drinking is injurious to health” should be prominently displayed on the bottle. The law also bars people under the age of 21 years and pregnant women from purchasing alcoholic drinks and government institutions from hosting events with alcoholic beverages. The rules also bar displaying advertisement in print or other digital media.

It has also listed restricted areas for sales, including public places, schools and colleges, religious and other historical sites. “But, the rules have not been implemented,” said the official. “So, we decided to introduce regulatory measures this time.”

The new regulation will allow up to five liquor shops in a single ward, he said.

Officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, which issues the alcoholic beverage licence, said that a few weeks ago, the Home Ministry had consulted with them on the draft.

“We also suggested enforcing effective regulations without hampering the existing manufacturing companies,” said officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.

According to the Federation of Liquor Associations of Nepal, 57 distilleries and nine breweries have received operating licences as of now.

Santosh Pandey, past president of the federation, however criticised the government’s move. He said that if the new law is endorsed, it will give rise to cartel in the liquor firms as there won’t be market competition at all. “The ban is not rational.”

According to the Health Ministry, at least 17.8 percent of the total population has a habit of drinking on a daily basis, while around 2 percent consume alcohol in harmful ways. A survey conducted in 2013 by the Nepal Health Research Council showed men were more likely to drink.

In Praise of Disregard,"Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments,",,2014-03-20 00:00:00,"Mar 20, 2014-

Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments, I spend many hours reading about the issues; but I have a tendency to dwell on stories I find truly distressing, such as tales of leaked videos showing the blunt discrepancy between a politician's on- and off-screen selves. I am drawn to the most hopeless headlines, the reports that make humans seem like wolves, the kind that make it impossible to stifle my expletives. I feel it physiologically: My adrenaline surges, my breaths get quick and short, and I pace and fume around the apartment trying to get rid of this nervous energy.

It doesn't matter what your political position is; reading or watching things that aggressively dispute all that you believe can produce this effect. Often, my whole afternoon is wrecked by reading one article or watching one debate. And that lost afternoon is irretrievable. Those hours I could have spent pursuing my research, or engaging creatively in something, or writing an article like this one, which demonstrates some faith in humanity, are lost because of a morbid attraction to provocative rhetoric and lost causes. But if a pundit screams brutishly in the forest and there is no one there to hear him, does he still make a sound?

Reality and the voices that claim to represent reality are not at all the same thing. And even if they were, given the abundance of problems that we are told each day need immediate attention, there is a certain threshold beyond which an individual cannot affect the universe. No amount of outrage can repair certain broken features of our politics, like the boundless partisanship and the punitive and reactionary attitudes displayed throughout Congress, whose forte is clearly not equanimity.

“Don't protest against what you disapprove. Do without it.” The Italian philosopher and mystic Lanza del Vasto gave this compelling advice in his 1945 book “Principles and Precepts of the Return to the Obvious.” His counsel, offered at the dusk of the Second World War in response to its barbarity, could be of service to us now, in our politically contentious culture where the realities of the information age bring us into contact each day with opinions that displease us.

In the past, it was easier to avoid what you didn't need to hear. Today, it requires a concerted effort to do so, and it still isn't possible to sidestep troubling views altogether. In addition, most public speech can now be commented on, and often is, thanks to the web. Recent years have confirmed that when things can be commented on, especially anonymously, people often become the worst versions of themselves. The opinions of others washing over us is the inescapable state of things today.

But it is possible to subdue those ideas that do violence to us. Ideas are given credence only when they are entertained. By disregarding them, we can erode much of their influence.

Disregard is sometimes negatively connoted in English. I do not suggest we should disregard other people or deny them respect. Nor am I advocating willful ignorance; putting on blinders to avoid what annoys us is not a solution, just an evasion tactic. What is problematic about the blinders metaphor is that it requires you to block out everything in your peripheral vision in order to stay focused on the task at hand, which means you might miss something beautiful or consequential. While it is unwise to shut your ears to opinions that differ from yours, it is equally unwise to let these opinions (particularly in their sensationalized iterations) carry you to total despair. I argue, rather, for a careful selection of what is injurious to you and an excision of it from your life and thought.

What I propose involves three steps: (1) a taking into account all positions, a kind of survey of possible ways to look at things, even those ways we find irritating; (2) identifying those ideas that degrade us and sap our energies; and (3) denying these ideas an existence in our personal spheres.

It is important to be sure that the ideas you want to eliminate from existence aren't those that would have spurred you to action in your actual life. For example, if getting angry about the retrogression of women's rights or about the increasing margin between rich and poor could impel you to get involved in your community to change these things, then, by all means, let the negative feelings fuel you. But many of the ideas we encounter, especially when rehashed in ever more amplified ways, serve only to distract us from the real issues. In a gesture of good faith and honesty with yourself, identify what you know you will never actually do anything about and eliminate it from your field of thought.

Imagine, for example, that you receive an angry email from someone and there is nothing you can do about the person's grievances. You read it. You accept your inability to change the situation. Then you delete it. Instead of leaving it in your inbox to pull your thoughts toward an irrevocable past, the symbolic act of throwing it away frees your mental energies for more worthwhile pursuits. This is a metaphor, of course. It is probably quite easy for you to delete an email that bothers your brain. But thoughts, which are as virtual as email, can be gotten rid of as well. In all their immateriality, thoughts and emails still impose an extraordinary amount of authority and influence on our actions and frames of mind. Doing away with them has the same effect as removing a concrete obstacle from sidewalk ahead of you.

The spirit of disregard I describe resembles the early Greek notions of apatheia and ataraxia, as well as the Serenity Prayer, invoked by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” But the distinction is that the method of disregard I've outlined asks for a systematic identification of the very specific things that take away your energy and an active effort to undo them. Rather than a simple and passive acceptance of the things you cannot control, I favor an acceptance and then a subsequent, symbolic deletion of those things.

I propose this method of disregard as a path to simmering down collectively. Regardless if you're on the left or on the right or anywhere in between, you've surely noticed how worked up we've become. There are obvious pressing issues at hand to be dealt with, but this helpless frenzy keeps us in a cycle of pointless trolling and political implosion. Getting flustered breathes life into other people's fictions. When your buttons have been pushed and your goat gotten, it is rare that you can act with composure in response. Instead, you react. Action derives from power, reaction from a state of powerlessness. While anger can be a catalyst for political action, it seems that much of the anger generated by mediatized political debates is never actually channeled toward fixing things. It is either pent up, leading to sullenness and self-devastation, or redirected toward others in destructive ways.

Finally, adopting a policy of disregard could be positive if for no other reason than one's own mental state of health. By doing away with the negativity and heaviness brought about by dwelling on toxic ideas, the blood pressure lowers, the muscles slacken, the jaw unclenches. The body undoubtedly enjoys respite every now and then from the assaults of such a charged environment.

In the climactic scene of the 1986 fantasy movie “Labyrinth,” as the protagonist faces off with the Goblin King, who had tried to control her, she declares with clear-eyed composure: “You have no power over me.” This simple declaration causes the Goblin King's supremacy to collapse, his kingdom to dissipate. By declaring that what disturbs you has no power over you, by disregarding its influence and “doing without it,” as Lanza del Vasto advises, you recover some of your vitality and self-possession.

So redirect time and efforts wasted on adversaries toward friends. Accrue your energies for better things. Dismiss what damages you.

Angelina Jolie questioned by FBI,Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.,,2016-10-27 00:00:00,"Oct 27, 2016-

Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.

Pitt is alleged to have gotten ""verbally abusive"" and ""physical"" with their son Maddox, 15, while under the influence of alcohol during a flight on September 14 and Jolie filed for divorce just days later.

After an anonymous source reported the alleged incident, the FBI got involved as they have jurisdiction because the incident occurred in mid-air.

""The agents wanted a breakdown of everything that happened from when the plane took off to when it landed. Angelina fully cooperated,"" a source told usmagazine.com.

The source added that the FBI ""will likely investigate for another few weeks"". After that they ""will present the case to the prosecutor, who will evaluate whether they feel the need to bring charges. It could potentially be months"".

Yet both Pitt and Jolie are eager to avoid a court case, with the source explaining: ""Neither side wants this to go to court because everything the FBI and DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) investigated will potentially be made available to the public, which would be bad for the entire family.""

It was later reported that ""Maddox suffered no injuries and some witnesses on the jet say Brad's contact with the boy was inadvertent"".

Meanwhile, it has been reported that DCFS have extended their investigation into Pitt.

The two and their children -- Maddox, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- have all been previously interviewed. The DCFS has now expanded its investigation to other alleged incidents.

Jolie and Pitt have agreed on a parenting plan, giving the actress temporary physical custody over the children with Pitt allowed to visit them under the supervision of a therapist.

Jul 19, 2016-In Nepal, long-term thinking is always seen as a formality. The concept of long-term planning has never been embedded in our thinking, although culturally, we participate in many rituals and deeds that look beyond the present time to our afterlife. And this continues to be the paradox: People who perform rituals to “fix” their afterlife and ensure that their children continue them for the same purpose fail to focus on long-term planning for themselves, their family or their organisations. Many ‘poverty specialists’ attribute this phenomenon—where people are only focused on their day-to-day living and are unable to think beyond two square meals—to extreme poverty and a series of famines in earlier centuries. But perhaps, Nepal has come a long way as indicated by our achievements of Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Sailesh Tiwari, who authored a World Bank report titled ‘Moving up the ladder: poverty reduction and social mobility in Nepal’, explains how Nepal has been able to reduce poverty in a time span comparable with countries like China. It is important for Nepal to prepare for the future and set some long-term goals.

Dependency syndrome

Culturally, the dependency syndrome that prevails in developing society like ours, fueled by the presence of free money, creates complications when it comes to vision for the future. In many Nepali families, a young man waits to furnish his room from the dowry he will receive. In villages, people who buy motorcycles, smartphones and lots of alcohol with their own money, wait for the assistance of some government body or NGO to build a toilet in their house. College kids rely on donations from companies and organisations to finance their fun-filled excursions, and political parties rely on anonymous funds, usually with strings attached, to help them run for elections. Banks with over half a billion of market capitalisation wait for some donor to subsidise the opening of a branch or the organisation of a programme. Dependency, in contrast to internal will, is one of the biggest impediments to making long-term plans. Dependency kills innovation, which is a key ingredient to envision the future.

Growth and investments

For Nepal to graduate to a middle-income country by 2030, when the country’s population will be around 36 million, it needs a $100 billion dollar economy with a per capita income of $2,500. To reach this mark, we need over eight percent growth each year. Economic growth can only occur if there are investments in infrastructure, entrepreneurship development and employment generation. This would require an investment of about $7 to 8 billion each year. Domestic investment capacities do not exceed $2 billion a year at present, which means we need foreign investment. Now if we are to attract foreign investment, we need a whole set of reforms that will enable us to compete with other nations. For many years, Nepal has been a country that receives one of the lowest foreign investments in the world. The inward looking Nepali society and businesses run by protectionist cartels and syndicates are keeping foreign investors at bay. We need to open up. What is the point of having a stock market with $15 billion market capitalisation when neither foreign investors are permitted to invest in it nor international players are allowed to recalibrate the market with an injection of contemporary technology and services? Cocooning ourselves from the outside world and finding newer protectionists strategies in the name of nationalism will continue to ail the country’s economy, a problem of over 200 years.

Certain milestones excite people globally. In the past, the turn of the century was

a big one; 2020 is considered another big milestone that pushed countries like Malaysia to conquer poverty and unleash economic potential. There are many countries that have been able to grow at a fast pace in last two to three decades. Landlocked Ethopia, for example, increased its GDP four times from $16 billion to $60 billion in ten years. Rwanda, during the same time period, grew three times. Nepal, however, could only double its GDP in that period. Countries like Ivory Coast that were written off are on the march to attract billions of dollars in foreign investments to unleash economic growth.

Formal and informal

Given the performances of countries similar to Nepal, it is not impossible for us to grow to become a $100 billion economy and

graduate to a middle-income country by 2030. For this, a big part of the

informal economy of the country needs to be converted into the formal economy by acquiring reliable statistics and expanding the taxation net. A large chunk of our economy is informal, which is very common in countries like ours, but it needs to graduate to formal economy at a quicker pace.

The six months of black marketeering pushed many formal sectors into the

fold of the informal, and the tendency to cheat the state and the consumers never ceases. Embracing global practices, facilitating tax payment, making government accountable and getting rid of a dependency mindset will all help us to convert a bigger part of the informal economy into the formal economy.

"Gunman kills nine at Oregon college, dies in shootout with police","A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death.",,2015-10-02 00:00:00,"People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon on Thursday.

Oct 2, 2015-

A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death, authorities said, in yet another burst of U.S. gun violence that ranked as the deadliest this year.

The suspect, who witnesses say fired dozens of shots into a classroom full of screaming students, was slain in an exchange of gunfire with two police officers in Snyder Hall at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg following the morning rampage.

He was not publicly identified by local authorities - the county sheriff vowed never to utter his name. But CBS, CNN, NBC and the New York Times named him as 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer, citing anonymous law enforcement sources.

""He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,"" the Times quoted one law enforcement official as saying.

CNN reported that three handguns and a ""long gun"" belonging to him were recovered from the scene. According to published eyewitness accounts, the gunman at one point ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before spraying the classroom with bullets.

""The law enforcement investigation into the shooter and his motivations is continuing,"" Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters at an afternoon news conference.

He also said three of the wounded victims were hospitalized in critical condition.

The massacre in Roseburg, a former timber town on the western edge of the Cascades some 260 miles (418 km) south of Portland, was the latest in a flurry of deadly mass shootings at American college and public school campuses, movie theaters, military bases and churches in recent years.

The 10 people killed surpassed the death tolls from two previous mass shootings - a gun battle between rival motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the rampage of a gunman at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, each of which claimed nine lives - to mark the deadliest incident of gun violence in the United States this year.

Not counting Thursday's carnage, a total of 293 mass shootings have been reported since January 2015, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that defines a mass shooting as any event in which four or more people are shot.

The killings have fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and better care for the mentally ill.

President Barack Obama, speaking just hours after the rampage, said the mass killing should move Americans to demand greater gun controls from elected officials.

""Somehow this has become routine,"" a visibly angry Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine. ...We’ve become numb to this.""

GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS

Kortney Moore, 18, told the local News Review newspaper that she was in her writing class in Snyder Hall when a gunshot came through the window and struck her teacher in the head.

Inside the classroom, Moore said, the gunman told people to get on the ground, then asked them to stand up and state their religion before he started shooting.

Freshman Kenny Ungerman told NBC that said he saw the shooter, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying a handgun as he went into the building, followed by gunshots and screams. Student Cassandra Welding told CNN that she heard 35 to 40 shots.

Student Brady Winder, in a posting on Facebook, said he was in a classroom next door to the room where the shooting began and ran, along with his classmates, when they heard the gunfire.

""I ran to the edge of the campus, down a hill and waited. From talking with a student in the classroom where it happen, almost every person in the room was shot by a man with four guns,"" Winder, 23, wrote.

PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center emergency room doctor Hans Notenboom told reporters three women about 18 to 34 years of age were flown to the hospital in Riverbend by helicopter, and two were moved directly into operating room.

Survivors were transported to a local fairgrounds, and some family members were left waiting for hours to see if their loved ones would be among them.

""We have grief counselors waiting for those parents who have no children getting off that bus,"" said the college's president, Rita Calvin.

Following the bloodshed state and federal authorities swarmed Roseburg, including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Police descended on an apartment possibly linked to the suspect about 2 miles (3 km) from campus, where police tape prevented access. It was not immediately clear who lived in the residence.

The college, which began its fall term this week and serves more than 13,000 students - 3,000 of them full time - said it would be closed until Monday. Hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil at nightfall.

In 2012, seven students at the small Christian college Oikos University in Oakland, California, were shot dead by a former student, marking the deadliest outburst of violence at a U.S. college since April 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech University killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before taking his own life.

The long road to recovery,Redundant rehab practices and social pressure hinder recovering drug users from sustaining their sobriety,,2011-01-07 00:00:00,"Jan 7, 2011-

Five guys stood at the front of the room wearing khadas and garlands of marigolds. Each took a turn making a speech into the microphone, thanking those who helped him achieve the milestone reached today and describing the obstacles on the road to get there. The speeches were followed by cake cutting and every combination of group photos possible. This was no ordinary award ceremony, it was a one-year birthday celebration of sobriety, and all five guys had, through hard work and struggle, managed to stay off intravenous drugs for a full year.

In his speech, one of the celebrants, Rakesh (name changed), explained how after six ‘tours’ of rehab and eight years involved in treatment, his family no longer believed his desire to be clean. “One day I went home and told my mom that I was leaving tomorrow for the centre. She said to me, ‘What are you going to do at the centre? The other ones didn’t work—you’ll be back within three or four months, using drugs again.’” But today Rakesh had achieved the one-year mark of sobriety and he was extremely proud of his accomplishment. “I’m happy because earlier I wasn’t able to stay in a centre for even three or four months, but now I have been clean for a whole year. I’ve left a lot of things behind.”

The birthday celebration is a common part of sobriety programmes, most notably Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), founded in 1935 in the US, and its sister organisation, Narcotics Anonymous, which is better known in Nepal as NA. It is also a hugely important component of addiction rehabilitation programmes in Nepal, which are heavily based on the theory of the twelve steps and practices of AA and NA. The twelve steps are a set of guiding principles for addiction recovery, developed by AA, that form the basis of most rehabilitation programmes. The first and most famous step is admitting powerlessness over alcohol or drugs.

This close modelling of Nepali rehabs after programmes in the US owes to the fact that the first centre in the country, Freedom Centre, was started in 1983 by an American pastor, the late Father Thomas Gaffney, and his Nepali partner who later travelled to the US to take inspiration from other centres. Since then, however, Nepali rehabs have evolved by mixing local cultural and societal norms such as an emphasis on social hierarchy with the American rehab programme basis, which emphasises the strength of fellowship—a close group of equals sharing experiences and interests, who share a history of drug use and the desire to stop using. The rehab programme at most centres in Nepal is a three-month residential programme (a little longer than the typical 30-60 day programme in the US) where clients live full-time at the centre, followed by nine months of after-care, during which clients attend the centre during the day and return home at night. The culmination of these 12 months is the birthday celebration, after which clients are set free to employ the skills and strategies they learned during rehab to stay sober outside the centre’s walls.

As exciting as celebrating the first birthday is, it can be a difficult time for people who have spent an entire year under close supervision of a tight network of recovery influences. In an already difficult economy, jobs are scarce for recovering drug users. Unlike in the urban US, where people typically have higher levels of mobility and education, recovering drug users in Nepal usually leave the centre and return to the same house and neighbourhood they grew up in, where everybody knows their secrets and drug-using status.

Just a few days after the high of his birthday celebration, Rakesh was coming down. “I haven’t taken nashaa (intoxicants), but everything else is bad,” he said, echoing a common recovery phrase which means that aside from a fragile sobriety, nothing is going well. Rakesh explained that as he no longer attended the centre (where he had spent six days a week for almost a year) his days were now spent sleeping until 5:00 pm after which he could expect to meet other recovering friends at Basantapur, where many in recovery spend their evenings as part of a ‘recovery fellowship’.

Like many other recovering users, Rakesh struggled to find employment with his limited education and virtually no work experience. In a community where jobs are typically garnered through connections, Rakesh’s connections all knew him as a drug user and feared hiring someone with that reputation, for he may steal money to use drugs again. Another recovering user confirmed their suspicions: he had lost his job after stealing 25,000 rupees from his boss to buy drugs. Besides, the livelihood programmes aimed to counter unemployment typically amount to little more than small handicraft work like candle- making, which is unlikely to provide substantial work or income to clients once they leave the centre.

The more than 40 rehab centres in Kathmandu do not have accurate records on relapse, but all acknowledge that rates are high. This is true in the US as well where relapse rates hover around 50 percent. Sustained sobriety is difficult to achieve and many of the economic and societal pressures that push Nepali people towards drug use—such as limited education, unemployment and few work opportunities, and strained family relationships in joint households—still exist once the year of treatment has ended. While the rehab centre offers a place and time to focus on sobriety, the emphasis on concrete ways to stay clean after treatment is not as strong.

In addition to the lack of social support and employment skills, recovering drug users fall victim to a dozen redundant practices adopted from the American system. Many slogans recovering users learn and are supposed to internalise, for example, do not work in the cultural context here. One of the most popular is the ‘ABC’ or Avoid Bad Circle slogan, which instructs recovering drug users to avoid friends and the old drug-using area. For Rakesh, who cannot move out from his family’s house, and whose old using partners lives just down the street, this is virtually impossible. “Once I come home, I don’t go outside. Down the block is my using partner. I only leave if I have any work or to go to the centre,” he explained. Another client who struggled to stay clean after leaving the centre and was known in Thamel for dealing agreed, “I try to hide and walk. But still, people [other users] say, ‘Oi! Come here.’”

Another practice that is lost in translation is the reliance on English language in meetings and programmes. English phrases like ‘self-esteem’ are used without an appropriate Nepali explanation, to clients who do not speak English. Clients themselves use these phrases, often without a good understanding of their meaning. It is incredibly difficult for recovering drug users in Nepal to achieve lasting sobriety. The large number of centres, emergence of AA and NA meetings, and greater awareness of drug use in Kathmandu is a step in the right direction. But it’s time to take it a step further and focus on serious job training and employment assistance, and to choose not to use inappropriate practices adopted years ago from the US system. Societal acceptance too will go a long way in allowing recovering users to move past their drug-using identity and turn a fragile sobriety into a lasting one.

After re-entering the centre for an abbreviated treatment after his 7th relapse, Rakesh was offered a job by a relative and has been able to maintain his sobriety by focusing on work. Every day is a struggle and Rakesh recognises that his sobriety continues to be extremely fragile. But he is counting down the months until he will celebrate his one-year birthday again.

Hard-drinking Lithuania wages battle against vodka,"Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.",,2017-08-30 00:00:00,"Aug 30, 2017-

Behind a heavy wooden door next to a Vilnius church, a couple of dozen Lithuanian men are talking about their dependence on alcohol. The moderator is Kestutis Dvareckas, a priest and a decade sober.

The World Health Organization ranks Lithuanians as the world’s heaviest drinkers.

WHO estimates published in May pegged average annual consumption at 18.2 litres (4.8 gallons) of pure alcohol per person in 2016, putting the small EU Baltic state ahead of Belarus, Moldova and Russia.

“Drinking on the job had been tolerated on various occasions since the Soviet era. Today, you still see alcohol at baptisms and burials,” Father Dvareckas, 37, told AFP. Rather than being social, drinking on these occasions is often excessive to the point of passing out.

Poor mental health and coping skills play a role, especially among Lithuanian men. WHO statistics from 2014 show that 16.7 percent of them abused alcohol or were dependent on it.

Largely at fault is “Lithuanian pessimism”, according to Visvaldas Legkauskas, a psychologist at Vytautas Magnus University in the central city of Kaunas.

“Life isn’t too bad here, but we have this character trait and we drown our sorrows in alcohol or we commit suicide,” he told AFP.

Dvareckas says he managed to quit drinking and get his life back thanks to a 12-step programme similar to the one used by Alcoholics Anonymous and the support of friends and family.

Wanting to pass on what he learnt, he created the free programme As Esu (“I am” in Lithuanian) in 2009, whose combination of group meetings, prayer, therapy and work opportunities help alcoholics get back on their feet.

An association created this year forged a network allowing 20 such communities to share resources. Other initiatives such as Alcoholics Anonymous are also afoot.

Burdened by the high social costs of heavy drinking, the government is taking action to curb consumption, including tax hikes and a blanket ban on alcohol advertising.

Fighting alcoholism was among the key campaign promises that gave the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union (LPGU) a surprise victory in 2016 elections. Its leader has been organising a booze-free cultural festival in his village for a decade.

Although parliament raised the tax on alcohol in March, consumption did not fall in the eurozone state of nearly three million residents.

Lawmakers then voted by a large margin in June to raise the legal drinking age to 20 from 18 and introduce a blanket ban on alcohol ads next year.

Whether these measures will work is another matter.

“Already back in 1998, Lithuania had adopted a strategy to curb consumption by 25 percent. But the reality is that it went up by 130 percent instead,” Health Minister Aurelijus Veryga told AFP.

For Father Dvareckas, the new legislation is not enough: “Why do I still have to pass the alcohol shelf at stores before reaching the one with dairy products?”

At a local store in the village of Semeliskes, located 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Vilnius, a saleswoman named Ona is sceptical.

“Prices may have gone up, but no one really cares. People will continue to buy as long as they have money, and they’ll buy five bottles instead of one to make sure they’re stocked,” she told AFP.

Many believe that to really be effective, the restrictions affecting sales must be coupled with other forms of help.

Medical treatment of alcoholics is still spotty in Lithuania, where the necessary medication is not paid for by the state, according to the national health insurance fund.

There are only five state-run alcohol rehab centres across Lithuania.

For Veryga, the health minister, it is critical “to ensure equal access to everyone concerned in the various regions”.

Our minds are structured in such a way that forbidden things hold far greater potential for satisfaction (albeit, perhaps, only psychological), than the things we are meant, and expected, to do. This fascination and desire for what is denied persists but as we grow older, we start choosing things that make sense, things that everybody says makes sense.

Of the many ‘Do-nots’ in our society are drugs. Do not do drugs. No further questions. They are bad for you. How bad? Are they worse than the other addictive substances and tendencies that society deems worthy of being ‘legal’? These questions fall by the wayside before even registering into mass consciousness.

Drugs, by definition, are substances that alter our pattern of activity—of processing thought, stimulations, everything. Some help keep us alive (in the physical sense) whereas, some by chance, create a dangerous vortex that swallows thoughts and lives whole. Thus, we separate what society terms medicine from what it calls drugs. It is the same with addiction. If it’s severe enough to mess up your social and personal life and space, it’s an addiction.

When an adolescent brain sees a skull and crossbones sign, chances are the danger and forbiddance will have them gravitating towards it. A vicious cycle can then result in a roundabout of deviant behaviour, marginalisation by society, neglect, burden, even death.

There has, throughout millennia, persisted a view of ‘drugs’ as inherently bad. That anyone who does drugs is not for society, is morally wrong. We shall call this the moral model. Once you marginalise a person from society for being morally corrupt, you start the process of dehumanising them. The treatment of those times reflected this. Confinement, punishment and even religious indoctrination were commonplace (even the Alcoholics Anonymous with its inflated success rates collected from telephone interviews, started with a dabble into the religious and later, the spiritual.)

This view has now been confined and banished to the island where bad ideas go to complain how unfair society is. We now know that drugs use is not as simple as a good/bad dichotomy. There are numerous variables that are at play, leading to substance abuse and dependence. There are numerous variables that increase one’s chances of addictive behaviour. Not all people who experiment with drugs go down its rabbit hole, and not all who go down fail to come out again. This approach to substance abuse and addiction has led to what is now the medical model. This model believes in finding out the root causes and psychopathology behind the behaviour. These could be as wide ranging as a South American shaman drinking ayahuasca to connect to mother earth and sadhus smoking ganja for a multitude of reasons to a college kid trying ‘brown sugar’ due to some misguided idea of ‘being cool’ and a professional adding a shot of vodka in their morning coffee before driving to work because he’s a bit uptight about the day’s presentation. There will always be reasons. We as psychiatrists and addiction specialists must find those reasons. In the best cases, we help find solutions and in the worst, help them live with it.

There have been and will always be drugs. It is society that has to coexist. Whether we do this by understanding addictive human behaviour and how drugs work, or by criminalising drug-related behaviour and legally or forcefully locking up people depends on us. Unfortunately, due to factors like lack of knowledge, confusion due to conflicting messages from various sources and the patient not having a say leads to many people still strongly believing this primitive idea that bad intentions and weak morals lead to drug use.

Experimentation is how human beings learn. We do things and stick with things that work. Not all people who do any particular drug become addicted to it. In fact, only 15 percent who drink alcohol will develop abuse or addiction problems. These studies have also been replicated in mice and show huge promise for the isolation of the ‘addiction gene’. There must be individual treatment plans in place for people with uniquely different problems. Experimental use, while being discouraged and managed as it should, must never be equated with the problematic use of substances. Shaming and forcing users to quit hardly seems like a long-term solution.

Prevention, of course, is the primary goal. But, how we go about that is paramount. Removing moral labels would be a good start. Current treatment methods, if they can be called that, are appallingly primitive. They need upgrading on all fronts; psychotherapeutic, pharmacotherapeutic and even the regulation of so-called rehabs. Then, there is maintenance. Unless something positive and fulfilling takes up the space previously occupied by drugs, the person will keep on going back to what they know best. There’s even a code name for people who are admitted to rehabs repeatedly.

I’ll finish with something a patient of mine told me when asked what he had achieved from his four stints at (various) rehabs: “I made a lot of damn good contacts, doc!”

heads and tales,"Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’",,2013-05-10 00:00:00,"May 10, 2013-

The Amrikis have Superman, Spider Man, Batman and Iron Man and, of course, many other ‘-mans’. But they are all just a bunch of fictional superheroes. Tony Stark is a billionaire and uses his powered suit of armour to protect the world as Iron Man.

We too have our own ‘Nepali’ billionaire in the Forbes list and he is real, alive and kicking just like you and me. Let us all hope that Binod dai will find ways to use his wealth to help the poor and the needy. He could follow the Warren Buffet formula and give most of his wealth to charity after he is gone and leave some pocket money for his kids. The chump change would still be enough for his kids to live a privileged life.

If he can come up with a fancy costume then he can be a superhero as well. The difficult part is finding the right name when he dons a costume. He could be the ‘Wai Wai Man’, who helps hungry folks with a free packet of Wai Wai. But eating only instant noodles will not make us healthy. Maybe Binod dai should invest in them apple farms in Jomson and we could get a free apple for every packet of Wai Wai we buy. At least them apples might compensate for a high sodium and low-fibre diet.

Here in this great land of ours, we have a real superhero now and his name is ‘Lokman’. Our beloved president has appointed him to head one of the most incompetent government bodies in Nepal—the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). Well, we still have yet to find an efficient government agency. That would be like trying to find dinosaur footprints in the middle of Ratnapark.

The CIAA has yet to find any politicians guilty of corruption. Well, a few former ministers went to prison and all they got was a year and half in Dillibazar Prison. The CIAA found our former IGPs guilty in the ‘Sudan APC Scam’ but what about our former home ministers and other political leaders who probably made some dough as well?

Superhero Lokman was the chief secretary during Gyanu Uncle’s direct rule. Does that make him an evil monster? No! He was just doing his job. After all, one cannot go far up the ladder if one does not kiss them arses. According to our media wallahs, the Maoists & Madhesis (M&Ms) wanted Lokman while the Nepali Kangaroos and the Unidentified Moronic Losers were pressured to support his appointment. Our clowns talk about foreign pressure every time they can’t agree on something.

Maybe our clowns wanted Lokman so that he would spend his days reading newspapers and drinking doodh chiya. If they left Lokman alone, then he’d do everything in his power to prevent any investigation of abuse of authority by our ‘new age’ clowns.

Or is it the other way around? It takes a crook to catch a crook. So far, our clowns have been running around town, shouting ‘catch me if you can’ and we have yet to find anyone from the days of the Shree Tins who are guilty of anything…till now.

So the CIAA should just shut down its offices and open a counselling centre for Amriki spies. It could be a ‘CIA Anonymous’ like the Alcoholics Anonymous. All CIA wallahs who have problems can visit and get some counselling from the CIAA. What could we teach them kuireys? Nothing, really, but our clowns can ask them to give us suitcases full of dollars like the ones Hamid Karzai receives.

When the bidhesis throw a tantrum, our clowns will do anything to pacify them. When we Nepalis throw a tantrum, they send the Nepal Police to show us their skills in laathi-charging! The bideshis threaten to cut down them foreign aid if they are not happy with our buffoons. And if there is no aid then there won’t be much room left for commissions.

No wonder, then, that a kuire can walk around town at two in the morning and the police will ignore him because they don’t want to waste their time learning English 101. If it’s a Nepali, then the police wallah will suddenly have enough questions to turn the investigation into some kind of a session with Sigmund Freud. We have yet to let go of that ‘white man—must be a rich man’ natak!

Our student unions want the government to send Lokman home. The smaller fishes want the president to resign. Leave Lord Rama alone. If Lokman can come back then why not bring Lord Vishnu as well? At least Gyanu Uncle can be the chief guest for all them jatras in the Valley.

Our student unions should gherao the Foreign Ministry and demand that Dorje Gurung, a former teacher at Qatar Academy, is freed from a Doha jail so he can come home and go trekking, rafting or even paragliding.

New alcohol control law in the offing,"The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.",,2018-11-22 00:00:00,"Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to shops

Nov 22, 2018-

The government has followed up a blanket ban on pornography by moving to control sales, consumption and production of alcohol, which it thinks are the main causes behind growing crime and rape cases.

Sources at the Home Ministry said that the draft of a new regulation on alcoholic beverage control is expected to be tabled at the Cabinet for approval next week.

Proposal includes capping the new licence to liquor manufacturing companies, imposing a blanket ban on the advertisement and restricting sales licence to liquor shops.

“We think the alcohol business has gone rampant and liquor shops have been creating new drinkers. It has been increasing crime and rape cases,” said a high-level source at the ministry, who wished to remain anonymous.

This is not the first time. Two years ago, the government had enforced the National Policy on Regulation and Control of Alcohol 2017, barring a pictorial warning that depicts liver cirrhosis and effects on other organs, covering at least 75 percent of the bottle. Under the rules, a statutory warning “Drinking is injurious to health” should be prominently displayed on the bottle. The law also bars people under the age of 21 years and pregnant women from purchasing alcoholic drinks and government institutions from hosting events with alcoholic beverages. The rules also bar displaying advertisement in print or other digital media.

It has also listed restricted areas for sales, including public places, schools and colleges, religious and other historical sites. “But, the rules have not been implemented,” said the official. “So, we decided to introduce regulatory measures this time.”

The new regulation will allow up to five liquor shops in a single ward, he said.

Officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, which issues the alcoholic beverage licence, said that a few weeks ago, the Home Ministry had consulted with them on the draft.

“We also suggested enforcing effective regulations without hampering the existing manufacturing companies,” said officials at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.

According to the Federation of Liquor Associations of Nepal, 57 distilleries and nine breweries have received operating licences as of now.

Santosh Pandey, past president of the federation, however criticised the government’s move. He said that if the new law is endorsed, it will give rise to cartel in the liquor firms as there won’t be market competition at all. “The ban is not rational.”

According to the Health Ministry, at least 17.8 percent of the total population has a habit of drinking on a daily basis, while around 2 percent consume alcohol in harmful ways. A survey conducted in 2013 by the Nepal Health Research Council showed men were more likely to drink.

In Praise of Disregard,"Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments,",,2014-03-20 00:00:00,"Mar 20, 2014-

Perhaps this experience sounds familiar to you: Sometimes, particularly during elections or other politically feverish moments, I spend many hours reading about the issues; but I have a tendency to dwell on stories I find truly distressing, such as tales of leaked videos showing the blunt discrepancy between a politician's on- and off-screen selves. I am drawn to the most hopeless headlines, the reports that make humans seem like wolves, the kind that make it impossible to stifle my expletives. I feel it physiologically: My adrenaline surges, my breaths get quick and short, and I pace and fume around the apartment trying to get rid of this nervous energy.

It doesn't matter what your political position is; reading or watching things that aggressively dispute all that you believe can produce this effect. Often, my whole afternoon is wrecked by reading one article or watching one debate. And that lost afternoon is irretrievable. Those hours I could have spent pursuing my research, or engaging creatively in something, or writing an article like this one, which demonstrates some faith in humanity, are lost because of a morbid attraction to provocative rhetoric and lost causes. But if a pundit screams brutishly in the forest and there is no one there to hear him, does he still make a sound?

Reality and the voices that claim to represent reality are not at all the same thing. And even if they were, given the abundance of problems that we are told each day need immediate attention, there is a certain threshold beyond which an individual cannot affect the universe. No amount of outrage can repair certain broken features of our politics, like the boundless partisanship and the punitive and reactionary attitudes displayed throughout Congress, whose forte is clearly not equanimity.

“Don't protest against what you disapprove. Do without it.” The Italian philosopher and mystic Lanza del Vasto gave this compelling advice in his 1945 book “Principles and Precepts of the Return to the Obvious.” His counsel, offered at the dusk of the Second World War in response to its barbarity, could be of service to us now, in our politically contentious culture where the realities of the information age bring us into contact each day with opinions that displease us.

In the past, it was easier to avoid what you didn't need to hear. Today, it requires a concerted effort to do so, and it still isn't possible to sidestep troubling views altogether. In addition, most public speech can now be commented on, and often is, thanks to the web. Recent years have confirmed that when things can be commented on, especially anonymously, people often become the worst versions of themselves. The opinions of others washing over us is the inescapable state of things today.

But it is possible to subdue those ideas that do violence to us. Ideas are given credence only when they are entertained. By disregarding them, we can erode much of their influence.

Disregard is sometimes negatively connoted in English. I do not suggest we should disregard other people or deny them respect. Nor am I advocating willful ignorance; putting on blinders to avoid what annoys us is not a solution, just an evasion tactic. What is problematic about the blinders metaphor is that it requires you to block out everything in your peripheral vision in order to stay focused on the task at hand, which means you might miss something beautiful or consequential. While it is unwise to shut your ears to opinions that differ from yours, it is equally unwise to let these opinions (particularly in their sensationalized iterations) carry you to total despair. I argue, rather, for a careful selection of what is injurious to you and an excision of it from your life and thought.

What I propose involves three steps: (1) a taking into account all positions, a kind of survey of possible ways to look at things, even those ways we find irritating; (2) identifying those ideas that degrade us and sap our energies; and (3) denying these ideas an existence in our personal spheres.

It is important to be sure that the ideas you want to eliminate from existence aren't those that would have spurred you to action in your actual life. For example, if getting angry about the retrogression of women's rights or about the increasing margin between rich and poor could impel you to get involved in your community to change these things, then, by all means, let the negative feelings fuel you. But many of the ideas we encounter, especially when rehashed in ever more amplified ways, serve only to distract us from the real issues. In a gesture of good faith and honesty with yourself, identify what you know you will never actually do anything about and eliminate it from your field of thought.

Imagine, for example, that you receive an angry email from someone and there is nothing you can do about the person's grievances. You read it. You accept your inability to change the situation. Then you delete it. Instead of leaving it in your inbox to pull your thoughts toward an irrevocable past, the symbolic act of throwing it away frees your mental energies for more worthwhile pursuits. This is a metaphor, of course. It is probably quite easy for you to delete an email that bothers your brain. But thoughts, which are as virtual as email, can be gotten rid of as well. In all their immateriality, thoughts and emails still impose an extraordinary amount of authority and influence on our actions and frames of mind. Doing away with them has the same effect as removing a concrete obstacle from sidewalk ahead of you.

The spirit of disregard I describe resembles the early Greek notions of apatheia and ataraxia, as well as the Serenity Prayer, invoked by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” But the distinction is that the method of disregard I've outlined asks for a systematic identification of the very specific things that take away your energy and an active effort to undo them. Rather than a simple and passive acceptance of the things you cannot control, I favor an acceptance and then a subsequent, symbolic deletion of those things.

I propose this method of disregard as a path to simmering down collectively. Regardless if you're on the left or on the right or anywhere in between, you've surely noticed how worked up we've become. There are obvious pressing issues at hand to be dealt with, but this helpless frenzy keeps us in a cycle of pointless trolling and political implosion. Getting flustered breathes life into other people's fictions. When your buttons have been pushed and your goat gotten, it is rare that you can act with composure in response. Instead, you react. Action derives from power, reaction from a state of powerlessness. While anger can be a catalyst for political action, it seems that much of the anger generated by mediatized political debates is never actually channeled toward fixing things. It is either pent up, leading to sullenness and self-devastation, or redirected toward others in destructive ways.

Finally, adopting a policy of disregard could be positive if for no other reason than one's own mental state of health. By doing away with the negativity and heaviness brought about by dwelling on toxic ideas, the blood pressure lowers, the muscles slacken, the jaw unclenches. The body undoubtedly enjoys respite every now and then from the assaults of such a charged environment.

In the climactic scene of the 1986 fantasy movie “Labyrinth,” as the protagonist faces off with the Goblin King, who had tried to control her, she declares with clear-eyed composure: “You have no power over me.” This simple declaration causes the Goblin King's supremacy to collapse, his kingdom to dissipate. By declaring that what disturbs you has no power over you, by disregarding its influence and “doing without it,” as Lanza del Vasto advises, you recover some of your vitality and self-possession.

So redirect time and efforts wasted on adversaries toward friends. Accrue your energies for better things. Dismiss what damages you.

Angelina Jolie questioned by FBI,Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.,,2016-10-27 00:00:00,"Oct 27, 2016-

Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.

Pitt is alleged to have gotten ""verbally abusive"" and ""physical"" with their son Maddox, 15, while under the influence of alcohol during a flight on September 14 and Jolie filed for divorce just days later.

After an anonymous source reported the alleged incident, the FBI got involved as they have jurisdiction because the incident occurred in mid-air.

""The agents wanted a breakdown of everything that happened from when the plane took off to when it landed. Angelina fully cooperated,"" a source told usmagazine.com.

The source added that the FBI ""will likely investigate for another few weeks"". After that they ""will present the case to the prosecutor, who will evaluate whether they feel the need to bring charges. It could potentially be months"".

Yet both Pitt and Jolie are eager to avoid a court case, with the source explaining: ""Neither side wants this to go to court because everything the FBI and DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) investigated will potentially be made available to the public, which would be bad for the entire family.""

It was later reported that ""Maddox suffered no injuries and some witnesses on the jet say Brad's contact with the boy was inadvertent"".

Meanwhile, it has been reported that DCFS have extended their investigation into Pitt.

The two and their children -- Maddox, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- have all been previously interviewed. The DCFS has now expanded its investigation to other alleged incidents.

Jolie and Pitt have agreed on a parenting plan, giving the actress temporary physical custody over the children with Pitt allowed to visit them under the supervision of a therapist.

Jul 19, 2016-In Nepal, long-term thinking is always seen as a formality. The concept of long-term planning has never been embedded in our thinking, although culturally, we participate in many rituals and deeds that look beyond the present time to our afterlife. And this continues to be the paradox: People who perform rituals to “fix” their afterlife and ensure that their children continue them for the same purpose fail to focus on long-term planning for themselves, their family or their organisations. Many ‘poverty specialists’ attribute this phenomenon—where people are only focused on their day-to-day living and are unable to think beyond two square meals—to extreme poverty and a series of famines in earlier centuries. But perhaps, Nepal has come a long way as indicated by our achievements of Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Sailesh Tiwari, who authored a World Bank report titled ‘Moving up the ladder: poverty reduction and social mobility in Nepal’, explains how Nepal has been able to reduce poverty in a time span comparable with countries like China. It is important for Nepal to prepare for the future and set some long-term goals.

Dependency syndrome

Culturally, the dependency syndrome that prevails in developing society like ours, fueled by the presence of free money, creates complications when it comes to vision for the future. In many Nepali families, a young man waits to furnish his room from the dowry he will receive. In villages, people who buy motorcycles, smartphones and lots of alcohol with their own money, wait for the assistance of some government body or NGO to build a toilet in their house. College kids rely on donations from companies and organisations to finance their fun-filled excursions, and political parties rely on anonymous funds, usually with strings attached, to help them run for elections. Banks with over half a billion of market capitalisation wait for some donor to subsidise the opening of a branch or the organisation of a programme. Dependency, in contrast to internal will, is one of the biggest impediments to making long-term plans. Dependency kills innovation, which is a key ingredient to envision the future.

Growth and investments

For Nepal to graduate to a middle-income country by 2030, when the country’s population will be around 36 million, it needs a $100 billion dollar economy with a per capita income of $2,500. To reach this mark, we need over eight percent growth each year. Economic growth can only occur if there are investments in infrastructure, entrepreneurship development and employment generation. This would require an investment of about $7 to 8 billion each year. Domestic investment capacities do not exceed $2 billion a year at present, which means we need foreign investment. Now if we are to attract foreign investment, we need a whole set of reforms that will enable us to compete with other nations. For many years, Nepal has been a country that receives one of the lowest foreign investments in the world. The inward looking Nepali society and businesses run by protectionist cartels and syndicates are keeping foreign investors at bay. We need to open up. What is the point of having a stock market with $15 billion market capitalisation when neither foreign investors are permitted to invest in it nor international players are allowed to recalibrate the market with an injection of contemporary technology and services? Cocooning ourselves from the outside world and finding newer protectionists strategies in the name of nationalism will continue to ail the country’s economy, a problem of over 200 years.

Certain milestones excite people globally. In the past, the turn of the century was

a big one; 2020 is considered another big milestone that pushed countries like Malaysia to conquer poverty and unleash economic potential. There are many countries that have been able to grow at a fast pace in last two to three decades. Landlocked Ethopia, for example, increased its GDP four times from $16 billion to $60 billion in ten years. Rwanda, during the same time period, grew three times. Nepal, however, could only double its GDP in that period. Countries like Ivory Coast that were written off are on the march to attract billions of dollars in foreign investments to unleash economic growth.

Formal and informal

Given the performances of countries similar to Nepal, it is not impossible for us to grow to become a $100 billion economy and

graduate to a middle-income country by 2030. For this, a big part of the

informal economy of the country needs to be converted into the formal economy by acquiring reliable statistics and expanding the taxation net. A large chunk of our economy is informal, which is very common in countries like ours, but it needs to graduate to formal economy at a quicker pace.

The six months of black marketeering pushed many formal sectors into the

fold of the informal, and the tendency to cheat the state and the consumers never ceases. Embracing global practices, facilitating tax payment, making government accountable and getting rid of a dependency mindset will all help us to convert a bigger part of the informal economy into the formal economy.

"Gunman kills nine at Oregon college, dies in shootout with police","A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death.",,2015-10-02 00:00:00,"People take part in candle light vigil following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon on Thursday.

Oct 2, 2015-

A gunman stalked onto a college campus in southwestern Oregon on Thursday and opened fire, killing nine people and wounding seven before police shot him to death, authorities said, in yet another burst of U.S. gun violence that ranked as the deadliest this year.

The suspect, who witnesses say fired dozens of shots into a classroom full of screaming students, was slain in an exchange of gunfire with two police officers in Snyder Hall at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg following the morning rampage.

He was not publicly identified by local authorities - the county sheriff vowed never to utter his name. But CBS, CNN, NBC and the New York Times named him as 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer, citing anonymous law enforcement sources.

""He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,"" the Times quoted one law enforcement official as saying.

CNN reported that three handguns and a ""long gun"" belonging to him were recovered from the scene. According to published eyewitness accounts, the gunman at one point ordered cowering students to stand up and state their religion before spraying the classroom with bullets.

""The law enforcement investigation into the shooter and his motivations is continuing,"" Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin told reporters at an afternoon news conference.

He also said three of the wounded victims were hospitalized in critical condition.

The massacre in Roseburg, a former timber town on the western edge of the Cascades some 260 miles (418 km) south of Portland, was the latest in a flurry of deadly mass shootings at American college and public school campuses, movie theaters, military bases and churches in recent years.

The 10 people killed surpassed the death tolls from two previous mass shootings - a gun battle between rival motorcycle gangs in Waco, Texas, in May, and the rampage of a gunman at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, each of which claimed nine lives - to mark the deadliest incident of gun violence in the United States this year.

Not counting Thursday's carnage, a total of 293 mass shootings have been reported since January 2015, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker website, a crowd-sourced database kept by anti-gun activists that defines a mass shooting as any event in which four or more people are shot.

The killings have fueled demands for more gun control in the United States, where ownership of firearms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and better care for the mentally ill.

President Barack Obama, speaking just hours after the rampage, said the mass killing should move Americans to demand greater gun controls from elected officials.

""Somehow this has become routine,"" a visibly angry Obama said. ""The reporting is routine. My response here, at this podium, ends up being routine. ...We’ve become numb to this.""

GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMS

Kortney Moore, 18, told the local News Review newspaper that she was in her writing class in Snyder Hall when a gunshot came through the window and struck her teacher in the head.

Inside the classroom, Moore said, the gunman told people to get on the ground, then asked them to stand up and state their religion before he started shooting.

Freshman Kenny Ungerman told NBC that said he saw the shooter, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying a handgun as he went into the building, followed by gunshots and screams. Student Cassandra Welding told CNN that she heard 35 to 40 shots.

Student Brady Winder, in a posting on Facebook, said he was in a classroom next door to the room where the shooting began and ran, along with his classmates, when they heard the gunfire.

""I ran to the edge of the campus, down a hill and waited. From talking with a student in the classroom where it happen, almost every person in the room was shot by a man with four guns,"" Winder, 23, wrote.

PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center emergency room doctor Hans Notenboom told reporters three women about 18 to 34 years of age were flown to the hospital in Riverbend by helicopter, and two were moved directly into operating room.

Survivors were transported to a local fairgrounds, and some family members were left waiting for hours to see if their loved ones would be among them.

""We have grief counselors waiting for those parents who have no children getting off that bus,"" said the college's president, Rita Calvin.

Following the bloodshed state and federal authorities swarmed Roseburg, including agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Police descended on an apartment possibly linked to the suspect about 2 miles (3 km) from campus, where police tape prevented access. It was not immediately clear who lived in the residence.

The college, which began its fall term this week and serves more than 13,000 students - 3,000 of them full time - said it would be closed until Monday. Hundreds of people attended a candlelight vigil at nightfall.

In 2012, seven students at the small Christian college Oikos University in Oakland, California, were shot dead by a former student, marking the deadliest outburst of violence at a U.S. college since April 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech University killed 32 people and wounded 25 others before taking his own life.
