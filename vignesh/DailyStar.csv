Serenity in the South China Sea,"The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.",,2015-07-03T00:00:00+06:00,"Diplomats and alcoholics don't always have as much in common as is sometimes assumed. But there is useful guidance for policymakers in the Reinhold Niebuhr prayer that Alcoholics Anonymous has made its own: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”

America's response to China's rise – and in particular to its assertiveness in the South China Sea – is a case in point. The United States should accept many dimensions of China's economic, and now military, growth with as much serenity as it can muster. But there are some that call for pushback, and the jury is still out on America's capacity to make the right calls.

The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.

Economically, the writing is on the wall. Despite US opposition to China's Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, much of the region has embraced it. And, again despite US resistance, it seems inevitable that the renminbi will join the International Monetary Fund's reserve-currency basket. Then there is the immense difficulty the US is having in bringing its China-excluding Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to fruition.

Militarily, while the US will remain the dominant global power for the foreseeable future, its absolute superiority in East Asia is no longer unchallenged. The dramatic build-up of China's military (especially naval) capability is no more than can be expected of a hugely trade-dependent regional superpower. It is not easy for some US leaders to say so publicly, but most acknowledge privately that America can no longer expect to have the seas and skies to itself. Its role will necessarily be scaled back to that of regional counterweight.

But how far should serenity extend when it comes to the South China Sea? This is the most sensitive geopolitical issue looming over Xi's state visit to the US in September. China has been stretching the limits of regional (and US) tolerance with its expansive sovereignty claims and massive land-reclamation activity – some 2,000 acres in the last 18 months – on Fiery Cross Reef and elsewhere. Pushback is required, but within defined limits.

What critics of China's land reclamation need to understand is that, even without any credible sovereignty claims to the sea area in question, or any islands within it, under international law China does have the right to build artificial islands and installations, including airstrips, on outlying reefs and shoals. The Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have been doing so for years in the Spratly Islands, albeit on a smaller scale. Although such installations must be for “peaceful purposes,” that does not necessarily exclude some military presence, provided the intent is non-aggressive.

The US cannot stop such activity and should not try. What it can do is make clear that reclamation activity does not, by itself, provide a foundation for any new sovereignty claim or exclusionary activity. The reclaiming country can set a 500-meter “safety zone” around such installations. That is all. China cannot claim a 12-mile territorial sea or a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ); nor can it put in place an air defense identification zone or any other kind of military exclusion operation. And the US is within its rights to make this point by flying surveillance aircraft to within 500 meters of such installations.

As for China's broader sovereignty claims, again some distinctions are necessary. To the extent that these claims are based on the “nine-dashed line” – embracing some 80 percent of the South China Sea and described as China's “historic waters” – the entire international community should reject them out of hand. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – now generally accepted as customary international law even by countries that, like the US, have failed to ratify it – is the only credible framework within which any kind of exclusive claims can be made.

On the other hand, to the extent that China's claims are based on long use or occupancy of particular habitable islands in the Spratly or Paracel groups or elsewhere (and as such consistent with UNCLOS, to which China is a party), they may be as credible as those of other regional players, if not more so. So the US and other outsiders are right not to take sides about competing claims, and to urge that they be resolved by negotiation or international adjudication, not by force.

Pending resolution of these competing claims, it is also appropriate, in the course of asserting the right to freedom of navigation, that the US and others treat as a de facto sovereign exclusion zone a 12-mile perimeter around such islands. After all, if they are not owned by China, they are owned by someone. As with the reef installations, the wise course is to minimise provocation.

On the issue of freedom of navigation, China should be believed when it says that it is not in the business of obstructing commercial shipping or flights anywhere in the South China Sea. But it has created difficulties for the US – and a continuing risk of inflammatory incidents – by insisting that, within the entire 200-mile EEZ extending beyond its territorial waters, no military ship or aircraft has a right to engage in surveillance and intelligence collection.

American pushback on this front, though justified, should be tempered. In the interest of defusing tensions, the US should scale back its monitoring activities within China's EEZs and rely more on less obviously intrusive means.

Managing the US-China relationship in general, and the South China Sea in particular, requires, above all, keeping official rhetoric under control. Lines will need to be drawn, but wise leaders will focus on cooperative diplomatic solutions, playing military cards to the minimum extent possible – and perhaps repeating to themselves, the AA serenity prayer before creating expectations that they cannot meet.

Govt eyes Arial Beel, 3 other sites (August 2, 2011)

Another attempt to waste money in the name of the Father of the Nation. Sheikh Hasina's persistence on this matter will bring disaster in the next election.

HH

We need a sea port before an airport because the survival of this country depends on that. The govt. should look for higher priority things than a mega airport.

Anonymous

All national economic and social sectors need fast development in a cost effective way without sacrificing our cultural values and not copying western institutions. Bengalis are weak in management, so management training is a priority before planning an international airport. Think fresh.

Dr Karim

I think government should totally rethink about the project and as a substitute of having a new airport at a different location, I strongly recommend that current international airport has room for expansion. BAF base located just opposite the airport can be relocated at a much cheaper price which should give us enough land to construct a parallel runway and a much bigger international terminal to suit the requirement for future. This is dynamic thinking and it is practical. We need half of the fund that is being proposed at current.

Sheikh Monirul Islam, Opee

While there has been no movement on strategic importance of building a higher capacity sea port, this unnecessary airport comes up again and again. The political parties are run by sycophants keeping the country from reaching it's potential.

NRB

It's very difficult to understand why the government is after this mega project when lot of their priority projects in socio-economic sectors are either remaining unattended or delayed for funding crisis and other technical disagreement with the donors. The highly talked about Padma Bridge is an example to cite here. Lot more will soon unveil.

Anonymous

There are so many areas and sectors crying for funds, expertise and attention but they are overlooked. Let us rename the existing airport after a massive renovation work. At least for a few years we can utilize the 'old' airport to the fullest if we are smart enough. Surely building a new airport is not a priority. We are languishing in many areas including education, health and infrastructure.

Ali

These Beels are still the rice basket of Bangladesh. But in Bangladesh, population is increasing and cultivable land is shrinking at a rapid speed. This cannot go well for long. Current food prices, inflation, unmatched income and expenditure for ordinary citizens are bound to cause a lot more sufferings and unrest in the coming years and decades. Decision makers, politicians, civil societies and most importantly the citizens need to speak out against these kinds of nonsense ideas and plans now to avoid disasters soon. Thanks to The Daily Star for publishing this report for the citizens Right to Know!

I absolutely support a new massive international airport. When I walk through any foreign nation's gigantic airport terminals, I literally look down to us. Some instant repliers will argue that we only utilize 70% of the total capacity of the existing airport. I have a different point of view. We can have a trash that can be totally unused. Already, most of the European airlines have declined to operate in Bangladesh due to the poor conditions of standards in our existing airport.

SNH

While there is no power, water, roads are broken and people are dying everyday from police brutality and terrorism, the prime minister is playing the flute like Nero making airports, port and Padma Bridge which are simply useless.

Zulfikar Ali

We felt relieved after the tragic incident at Arial Beel when PM declared that no more new airport will be built. But sudden change of her mind shocked us. It seems BD is floating on immense wealth when global recession is engulfing the whole world.

Yamin

We need service to satisfy to our people. We need to develop rather than to expend huge amount on such unproductive purpose at this moment.

Nasarullah

None of the foreign country including USA should allow Hasina's plan to build the airport and kill humanity.

"The price for lunch with Warren Buffett: $3,300,100","An anonymous bidder agrees to pay $3,300,100 at auction to have a private lunch with Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.",,2018-06-04T19:32:10+06:00,"An anonymous bidder has agreed to pay $3,300,100 at auction to have a private lunch with Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The winning bid came near the end of a five-day online auction on eBay to benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco charity that serves people who are poor, homeless or battling substance abuse.

It was the third highest price in the 19 years Buffett has offered lunch, near the record $3,456,789 bid in both the 2012 and 2016 auctions. This year’s auction drew 136 bids from just six bidders before ending on Friday night.

The auction helps cover Glide’s $20 million annual budget, which goes toward providing roughly 750,000 free meals, shelter, HIV and Hepatitis C tests, job training, and children’s day care and after-school programs.

“Glide really takes people who have hit rock bottom and helps bring them back,” Buffett said in a statement.

Buffett, 87, has raised $29.6 million for Glide through the 19 auctions.

His first wife Susan, who died in 2004, introduced him to Glide after volunteering there. The Reverend Cecil Williams, 88, Glide’s charismatic co-founder, remains a minister at its affiliated church.

“The $3.3 million is an extraordinary gift, not just the money but the fact that Warren Buffett lends his name and reputation and shines a light on the work Glide does,” Glide’s president, Karen Hanrahan, said by phone. “Demand for our services is skyrocketing, in this city of innovation and wealth.”

The winning bidder and up to seven friends can dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan.

Buffett will discuss anything apart from what he might invest in next.

Ted Weschler, a hedge fund manager, paid a combined $5.25 million to win the 2010 and 2011 auctions, and later joined Berkshire as one of Buffett’s investment managers.

Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad, real estate and other sectors, and also invests in companies such as Apple Inc, Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co.

According to Glide, these bidders have won its auctions:

The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region. The death toll could rise further as officials said some of the afflicted were in a critical condition.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has ordered an inquiry.

State police said they had arrested one man for selling the liquor, and authorities said two excise department officials were suspended for failing to take adequate precautions over the sale of the alcohol.

The political leaders in Bangladesh are kind-hearted persons. They even pardon the multiple killers (if they are their own people).

Dr. Nazmul Haq

I would like to ask Mr. Sen Gupta whether the president of Bangladesh has the capacity to read the files sent to his office for his signature and ask question about the content of the files which he is signing, or not.

Mahmood

I wish the government showed 25 percent of this mercy to our poor one-legged Limon. His leg actually was taken away from him by the government. I wonder if Limon was more dangerous criminal than this murderer who walks freely now!

Kabir Ahmad

Suranjit Sen Gupta urged not to blame President Zillur Rahman for granting clemency to Biplob and criticised the Home Ministry for not discussing with Law Ministry. But it was not clear whether this recommendation was submitted to the President directly from the Home Ministry or through the PM. In any way neither the President nor the Prime Minister can be excused for such injustice. This was unfair.

M. Talukdar

Clemency to a convicted murderer without proper procedures and justifications is another nail in the coffin of rule of law in Bangladesh. It has exposed flaws in legal and administrative systems of Bangladesh. No country can flourish and no government can govern effectively with this kind of deficiencies. Instead of looking for guilt, we should look for structural solutions of these pitfalls in our system.

Tomal

Whoever is responsible for granting this clemency doesn't matter. It is true that a killer has been granted it; the family of Nurul Islam is deprived of justice and it is regretful that even the Prime Minister herself defended it terming it as a politically motivated case. The government must review this clemency for the sake of justice and political stability.

OpeeMonir

Is Suranjit Sen a middleman to negotiate between the government functionaries and President's office? People are not stupid. We all know that the procedure is such. But President should look at the merit of each individual case. He just cannot sign it blindly simply saying that it did not go well with the people.

A concerned Citizen

Suranjit made this statement the way elders sometimes try to console disappointed toddlers just as a precautionary measure to avoid any further demotion. Everybody knows that such a matter can not reach the President's Office without being routed through PM's office. And this belief has been further strengthened by the PM herself by defending the pardon publicly on the ground of 'politically motivated conviction'. Had Suranjit been sincere enough on this issue? He would have rather suggested to sorting out a way on sealing the very constitutional loophole which might lead the country's highest office to face such embarrassment.","['office', 'respond', 'sent', 'ministry', 'suranjit', 'recommendation', 'readers', 'way', 'bangladesh', 'sen', 'clemency', 'president']","AnonymousIt was the President who gave the clemency and he could reject the recommendation sent by the Home Ministry.

In this category, our 'golden boys' have surpassed all records. Not any of these 'golden boys' had to face any trial. The most tragic part of the story is that they are the sons of this independent country and raped their fellow country girls. How outrageous! What a shame!

S Ali

Sayedee used to deliver lectures in big gatherings almost all over Bangladesh during the period of Bangabandhu. But then no step was taken against him. Even during the previous term of the Awami League (AL) government, his party Jamaat-e-Islami was a close ally of the ruling party. If the charges framed against him are facts, how could he escape punishment during the past forty years?

The war criminals should not be forgiven for their crimes. I am disgusted to see how some people have been trying to protect these criminals from being prosecuted.

The Daily Star cartoon and its report on the subject indicate that the daily has already given its judgement. The norm is, the suspect is innocent until proved guilty.

It is unbelievable to see how many people are against this case.

How about punishing him according to the Islamic Shariah Law?

Sayedee is a shame for Bangladesh and should be executed in public before BNP comes to power again.

We salute Farzana. I request The Daily Star and other media houses to start a social campaign against dowry.

Md Arifur Rahman

She would become the icon of thousands of women. Every man and woman should take a strong-stand against dowry to rid society of this curse.

M I Arif

It is a lesson for us towards removing dowry from our society. May your voice become the voice of all women and raise the level of awareness of men, too..

Muktadir S Hossain

This is just the beginning. This is a warning for all those beggars who look for dowry. Congrats Farzana. We all are with you.

Md. Mafizul Islam

Farzana, you have made a lot of change. You are the path finder. I believe we will find many more Farzanas in the future, who will teach a good lesson to the greedy as well as find a society free from the curse of dowry.

Younus Ali

I have a daughter. So I have also some tension in my mind. I will be in need of a lot of money during her wedding as dowry, although I hate this custom. In my case, I didn't take any money as dowry when I married. Now I have learnt something. I believe my daughter will also protest against dowry like Farzana.

Anonymous

Good job Farzana, I admire your courage and conviction. May Almighty Allah be on your side and hopefully you will find a real man soon. Hopefully, other women will learn from you too.

Nasirullah Mridha

I read in other national daily that Farzana's husband and his aunt are headmasters at primary schools. Can I expect that the government would arrange severe punishment for the two teachers who forced Farzana's family to give the dowry?

Shamima Begum Shelley

I hope all the girls and their families & relatives will learn from this extraordinary event. We congratulate her for opening our eyes.

T. Husain

I salute Farzana for her courage and self-esteem. She should be the icon and role-model of womanhood in any decent society.

Upfront

What an inspiring and at the same time a tragic story! I think the responsibility now lies with society to help Farzana out of this ordeal and assist her in all ways to get the divorce immediately and create the opportunity to get married to a person who is according to choice, age and standards. Any follow up story would be appreciated. We wish a happy and peaceful life for Farzana.

Zaman

A very inspiring move by the young lady. The demand for dowry made by the husband's aunt proves that the so-called women-friendly laws aren't working. We need to change the attitude of dowry-seeking women and in this way end this evil practice. Imams can also help by letting people know that dowry is not allowed in Islam. In fact, Islam obligates the husband to pay a pre-arranged amount for the wife. This better system should be encouraged.

Didarul Alam

We appreciating this bold decision from a conscious & educated woman. The term dowry has become a cancer. It is a curse of our society. Not only women but men also should come forward to eliminate this curse from society. In our country, the rich people give a lot of valuable things to their daughter's bridegroom in the name of gift which encourages the practice of dowry among the immoral & greedy people. We must raise our voice against it and take lesson from Farzana's bold protest against it.","['respond', 'lesson', 'daily', 'farzana', 'lot', 'readers', 'farzanas', 'women', 'society', 'voice', 'curse', 'dowry']","Every man and woman should take a strong-stand against dowry to rid society of this curse.

Release them before Eid,"Retired army officer Shafiqul Islam knocked on every possible door in the last one and a half months, hoping someone would help his son Tariqul Islam get bail.",,2018-08-18T00:00:00+06:00,"Retired army officer Shafiqul Islam knocked on every possible door in the last one and a half months, hoping someone would help his son Tariqul Islam get bail.

He appointed a lawyer after his son, a law student of Dhaka University, was arrested on July 3 during the quota reform demonstrations.

The 60-year-old has been travelling from home in Comilla to the capital hoping to be able to do something. But Tariqul, also a member of Chhatra League in DU, was denied bail twice.

The grieving father attended a human chain formed by the families of students detained during the quota reform and road safety demonstrations in front of Jatiya Press Club.

They demanded release of the students before the coming Eid and urged the prime minister to intervene. Rights activists and civil society members also attended the programme.

Shafiqul's son was arrested in a case filed over vandalism at the VC's residence on DU campus.

Shafiqul added that he too was a member of the Awami League in Comilla.

“I don't know where I should go.... None of the ruling party men I have contacted helped me,” he said, adding he had also contacted the DU authorities to no avail.

Saleha Begum, mother of arrested quota reform leader Muhammad Rashed Khan, said, “Please release my son before Eid. Let me celebrate the Eid with him.”

Since Rashed was arrested on July 1, she has been travelling from Jhenidah to Dhaka to join public events and demand his release.

Saleha said her son was never against the government.

Rights activist Nur Khan said “arbitrary” detention and arrest of students caused widespread fear. “The nation needs to be free from the fear.”

Eastern University teacher Rezaur Rahman Lenin said around 200 students were picked up and nearly 100 cases filed during the two widespread demonstrations.

Saiful Azam, a final year student of the University of Asia Pacific, said he and several other students of the university were attacked on August 5 while demonstrating on Green Road for road safety.

But instead of finding out the attackers, police picked up some of the students that evening and released them later.

Nur Khan, who helped organising the human chain, said some families of the arrestees did not attend the programme fearing reprisal.

Nagorik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna said no political slogan was chanted during the road safety demonstrations.

“Yet, the government was afraid of their agitation,” he said.

He also pointed out that those who attacked the students and journalists during the demonstrations remained untouched.

Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Zafrullah Chowdhury said students being tied with ropes was not the sign of a civilised society.

Photo: Mumit M.",,2011-03-11T00:00:00+06:00,"The ongoing fortnight-long theatre festival by the Department of Theatre, Dhaka University featured two plays on March 9. The plays -- ""Ashchorjo Shundor Ei Bechey Thaka"" and ""Durghotona"" -- were staged at Natmandal Auditorium of DU.

Tanvir Rashid directed ""Ashchorjo Shundor Ei Bechey Thaka"".

The play is an optimistic approach to those who find themselves unnecessary to the society. The play tries to convey the message: every moment alive is special.

Mahfuzur Rahman, Atiqur Rahman, Shushanto Sarkar and Camellia Moushumi Khan enacted the roles in the play. Camellia also did the set, light and costume designing.

The second play of the evening was ""Durghotona"". Written by Sudipta Bhoumik, the play was directed by Bhudev Chandra Mandal.

""Durghotona"" is psychological drama. It highlights two characters. One of them is a Bangladeshi, who went to the US in search of a better life. The other character's identity remains in the shadows. Throughout the play, the Bangladeshi describes his days from the past to the stranger who seems uninterested to listen.

Until the last sequence, the Bangladeshi's narratives seem incoherent but the twist comes when it is revealed that the character has been dead all along.

Tauquir Ahmed and Syed Muhammad Zubayeer donned the roles of the Bangladeshi and the anonymous character respectively.

Tanvir Nahid Khan designed the set. Khan along with Bithika Yasmin did the light designing.

The one-member committee chief Prof Taslima Begum, director (Training) of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE), has already started her investigation.

""The investigation so far reveals that Abdul Hannan, one of the alleged persons, usually serves as a peon at the institute although he is not an employee there. But he was engaged in scrutinising the papers of the training participants. The officials concerned need to answer why and how he was given the charge,” said Prof Taslima, who was seen taking written statements of the officials and employees and examining pieces of evidence at the institute yesterday noon.

Hannan earlier worked in a project that ended in 1999.

""Two other employees Jahangir Hossain and Shafik Ahmed were also not supposed to be engaged in the scrutiny. Even if they were given the task, the officials concerned failed in their duty to properly supervise and guide so that the scrutiny is done properly,” the probe team chief said.

Following an anonymous telephone call on May 26, the institute authorities found that a staggering 56 of 84 participants in the May 22-27 teaching quality improvement (TQI) training programme were fake.

Students, small traders, non-teaching service-holders, even nearly illiterate people were enrolled for the six-day training programme meant for headmasters.

The 56 people were listed as 'headmasters' of non-existent schools apparently to embezzle a portion of the money allocated for the training under a project funded by Asian Development Bank and Canadian Development Agency (Cida).

Institute Director Dr Swapan Kumar Dutta supervised the training while Additional Director Dr Shelina Afroze and assistant directors M Shamsuzzoha and Sirajum Munira coordinated the programme.

Earlier a three-member probe committee headed by Rajshahi New Government College teacher Shamsul Kalam Azad was formed to probe the irregularity in the training programme but the investigation faced difficulties after a certain stage as the institute director is senior to the probe body chief in government service rank.","['director', 'training', 'institute', '56', 'officials', 'committee', 'chief', 'scrutinise', 'probe', 'yesterday', 'programme', 'engaged', 'documents', 'outsider']","The education ministry yesterday formed a committee to investigate enrolment of 56 fake headmasters for a government-run training programme at Secondary Teachers Training Institute in Rajshahi, five days after disclosure of the incident.

Jose lashes out at Scholes,Jose Mourinho has lambasted former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes after he criticised the manager and key players in his,,2018-01-03T00:00:00+06:00,"Jose Mourinho has lambasted former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes after he criticised the manager and key players in his role as a TV pundit.

Scholes singled out Paul Pogba, the club's record signing, after his anonymous performance in the weekend draw with Southampton.

But the French international was far more impressive in the 2-0 victory at Everton on New Year's Day, which ended a run of three consecutive United draws and put the Red Devils 12 points behind runaway leaders Manchester City.

The victory allowed Mourinho to launch a remarkable verbal attack on Scholes, one of the storied ""Class of 92"" who was a key part of some of the greatest successes in United's history.

""I think the only thing Paul Scholes does is criticise,"" said Mourinho. ""I don't think he comments, I think he criticises, which is a different thing.

""Not every one of us has to be phenomenal like he was as a player. That does not mean that we all have to be phenomenal.""

Scholes accused Pogba of coasting through games and failing to make the sort of impact his £89 million ($120 million) transfer fee demands.

But Mourinho was clearly in the mood to defend his player and claimed that part of Scholes' attitude was fuelled by jealousy.

""Paul tries to do his best all the time,"" he said. ""Sometimes he plays very well, sometimes he plays well, sometimes he doesn't play so well.

""It's not Paul's fault that he made much more money than Paul Scholes. It's just the way football is.

""I think Scholes will be in history as a phenomenal player, not as a pundit. I prefer to look at him as a phenomenal player that gave so much to the club that I am proud to represent.""

The United manager, who won at Goodison thanks to superb goals from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard, both of which were set up by Pogba, also believes that Scholes has a desire to break into management.

The former United player recently claimed that his application for a job managing United's under-23 team was turned down by the club's management.

""If Paul one day decides to be a manager I wish that he can be 25 percent as successful as myself,"" said Mourinho.","['mourinho', 'pogba', 'manager', 'united', 'lashes', 'think', 'paul', 'jose', 'scholes', 'victory', 'phenomenal', 'player']","Jose Mourinho has lambasted former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes after he criticised the manager and key players in his role as a TV pundit.

The handwritten missive, sent in 1928 by Einstein from Berlin to a mathematician about the formalisation of the ""Third Stage of the Theory of Relativity"", was snapped up by an anonymous buyer for $103,700 (83,600 euros).

The letter was written during one of the ""most exciting, feverish periods of Einstein's scientific career"" as he worked to hammer out one of the major scientific breakthroughs of the last century, auction house Winner's said.

It included a second note jotted by Einstein on the back of the envelope refining his thinking.

ZTE woes loom as US-China trade tensions rise,"With a major Chinese smartphone maker on the rocks following US sanctions, the trade spat between Washington and Beijing appears to be taking a turn for the worse for tech firms in the two global economic powerhouses.",,2018-05-14T00:00:00+06:00,"With a major Chinese smartphone maker on the rocks following US sanctions, the trade spat between Washington and Beijing appears to be taking a turn for the worse for tech firms in the two global economic powerhouses.

Chinese telecom giant ZTE said in the past week its major operations had ""ceased"" following last month's US ban on American sales of critical technology to the company, raising the possibility of its collapse.

ZTE depended on American chips and other components, and is unable to continue operating without key supplies.

US officials imposed the ban last month, saying ZTE failed to abide by an agreement to stop selling to Iran and North Korea.

While the ZTE case has a specific legal basis, the ban comes as US-China trade relations have hit a rough patch, amid an intense rivalry for supremacy in key technology fields such as artificial intelligence and 5G, the next-generation wireless systems in the works.

The US administration has barred military and government employees from using smartphones from ZTE and fellow Chinese maker Huawei.

President Donald Trump earlier this year blocked a deal that would have allowed a Singapore-based firm to acquire US chipmaker Qualcomm, claiming it would enable Huawei to set the pace the global rollout of 5G technology.

The trade troubles threaten a technology sector that is increasingly intertwined with major players in the United States and China.

""It's going to disrupt procurement, supply lines, it will affect a lot of companies in various ways,"" said one technology industry executive who asked to remain anonymous.

""Nobody's panicking yet but people are nervous and watching.""

James Lewis, a technology specialist with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the tensions are likely to prompt China to step up efforts to disconnect from the US tech sector.

""The biggest impact will be to accelerate China's desire to have non-American sources of supply,"" Lewis said.

""They don't want to be held hostage"" to US tech firms.

Lewis said the technology trade tensions stem from genuine concerns in Washington that critical 5G and related telecom technologies will be dominated by China-based Huawei.

“Huawei is trying to become the telecom company for the world,"" Lewis said.","['ban', 'lewis', 'tensions', 'trade', 'zte', 'major', 'loom', '5g', 'washington', 'rise', 'uschina', 'technology', 'telecom', 'tech', 'woes']","ZTE depended on American chips and other components, and is unable to continue operating without key supplies.

Trump took to Twitter to brand reports of Tillerson's imminent replacement ""FAKE NEWS!"" -- although the US leader's admission that he has had to overrule his top diplomat on policy will only fuel the rumours.

Tillerson is due to embark on a major European trip today, despite anonymous White House leaks suggesting that he is to be replaced, perhaps within weeks, by a Trump loyalist.

The relationship between Trump and Tillerson has been dogged for months by reports of a rift.

On Thursday, these came to a head when several US media outlets -- citing White House sources -- predicted Tillerson's resignation and replacement by CIA chief Mike Pompeo.

Asked by reporters at a State Department photo call whether leaks from the White House were designed to force him out, Tillerson said: ""It's laughable. It's laughable.""

The White House at first did little to downplay the reports, while a State Department spokeswoman insisted Tillerson's position was safe, and the story drifted into a second day.

English department teacher Prof AFM Rezaul Karim Siddiquee was attacked from the rear while he was waiting for the university bus this morning. He died on the spot.

He was found lying on his face with deep gashes on his neck, Commissioner Shamsuddin said. “It appears that the killers were trained and experienced.”

Rajshahi Metropolitan Police (RMP) Commissioner Md Shamsuddin told our local correspondent that the manner of murder – the use of sharp weapons – was similar to the case of blogger killings.

A witness told The Daily Star requesting anonymity that she saw two people leaving on a motorcycle from the spot. “He was lying face down in a pool of blood.”

His colleagues did not have a clue as to the motive of the murder. A teacher of English department, Prof Shahidullah, said: “He was a peace-loving person. There’s no chance he had any enemy.”

Later in the day, the slain professor’s son Sourav filed a murder case with Boalia Police Station against anonymous people.

Shahadat Hossain, the officer-in-charge of the police station, confirmed it to The Daily Star this evening.

Meanwhile, Rajshahi University students demonstrated at campus, bringing out processions and blocking a major city road for some time, protesting the murder.

The northern division has been plagued by a series of untoward incidents for the past seven months that relate to militancy that resulted in death of at least two people including a foreigner.

Responsibility of all of the attacks, bomb blasts and killings have been claimed by militants.

The string of incidents started with killing of Japanese national Kunio Hoshi in Rangpur in October last year and carried on with bomb blasts in two Hindu temples in Dinajpur.

Then, there were incidents of shooting of an Italian priest, killing of a Hindu priest and bomb blast on a Shia mosque in Bogra that killed one person.","['murder', 'prof', 'teacher', 'claims', 'site', 'killing', 'rezaul', 'ru', 'university', 'unknown', 'rajshahi', 'responsibility', 'sued', 'group']","Hours into the killings of Rajshahi University teacher AFM Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, militant group Islamic State claimed the responsibility of attack, according to US-based SITE Intelligence Group.

Panama president seeks global efforts to handle tax haven row,"Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela called on Tuesday for global efforts to tackle the ""Panama Papers"" scandal, insisting it is not a",,2016-04-20T00:00:00+06:00,"Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela called on Tuesday for global efforts to tackle the ""Panama Papers"" scandal, insisting it is not a problem just for his country but the international financial system as a whole.

Panama is scrambling to avert redesignation as a tax haven that assists money laundering after the disclosure of the offshore dealings of many of the world's wealthy, famous and infamous. They came to light when millions of documents covering nearly 40 years of business were leaked from the archives of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

The revelations have had far-reaching political consequences, already bringing down the Icelandic prime minister and Spain's industry minister, while forcing others to explain their financial dealings.

""(The)'Panama Papers', it is not about Panama,"" Varela, who arrived in Japan on Sunday, told an investment seminar in Tokyo.

""It's about a global problem that is tax evasion and also the use of the financial systems and legal system,"" he added.

Varela said his country is willing to cooperate with an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development initiative to share tax information, saying: ""We have the door open to do it in a multilateral way.""

He also reiterated his demand that France drop Panama from a blacklist of tax havens.

Following the recent disclosures Paris has put Panama back on its national list of Uncooperative States and Territories. It had removed it in 2012.

Such an international designation would deal a heavy blow to Panama's vital financial services sector. The Panamanian government recently imposed reforms to move it towards global transparency standards.

Varela said he plans to announce a bilateral taxation scheme with Japan under OECD standards on Wednesday following his meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The world's leading economies took a step last week toward denying tax evaders and money launderers the ability to hide behind anonymous shell companies.

Acting in the wake of the scandal, finance chiefs of the Group of 20 meeting in Washington on Friday supported proposals requiring authorities to share the identities of shell companies' real owners.

They also backed creating a blacklist of international tax havens that do not cooperate with information-sharing programmes.

On Monday Varela said in an interview with Kyodo News agency that Panama has ""decided to join the common reporting standards"", referring to the measures on exchanging financial account information with tax authorities set by the OECD.

OECD head Angel Gurria said last week that Isabel De Saint Malo, vice president of the Central American country, had called him to express willingness to cooperate with his organisation.","['panama', 'financial', 'haven', 'varela', 'international', 'seeks', 'cooperate', 'global', 'tax', 'panamanian', 'row', 'country', 'handle', 'efforts', 'minister', 'president']","Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela called on Tuesday for global efforts to tackle the ""Panama Papers"" scandal, insisting it is not a problem just for his country but the international financial system as a whole.

"Soon after governor signs gun bill, NRA sues to block it","Weeks after their children were gunned down in the worst high school shooting since Columbine, parents of the victims stood in the Florida Capitol and watched Gov Rick Scott sign a far-reaching bill that places new restrictions on guns.",,2018-03-10T10:42:38+06:00,"Weeks after their children were gunned down in the worst high school shooting since Columbine, parents of the victims stood in the Florida Capitol and watched Gov. Rick Scott sign a far-reaching bill that places new restrictions on guns.

Hours later, the National Rifle Association filed a federal lawsuit to block it.





The new law capped an extraordinary three weeks of lobbying after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, with student survivors and grieving families working to persuade a Republican-run state government that had shunned gun control measures.

Surrounded by family members of the 17 people killed in the Valentine’s Day shooting, the GOP governor said the bill balances “our individual rights with need for public safety.”

“It’s an example to the entire country that government can and has moved fast,” said Scott, whose state has been ruled for 20 years by gun-friendly Republican lawmakers.

Tony Montalto, whose daughter Gina was killed in the shooting, read a statement from victims’ families: “When it comes to preventing future acts of horrific school violence, this is the beginning of the journey. We have paid a terrible price for this progress.”

The bill fell short of achieving the ban on assault-style weapons sought by survivors. The gunman who opened fire at the school used such a weapon, an AR-15 rifle.

Nevertheless, the bill raises the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, extends a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns and bans bump stocks, which allow guns to mimic fully automatic fire. It also creates a so-called guardian program enabling some teachers and other school employees to carry guns.

The NRA insisted that the measure “punishes law-abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of a deranged individual.”

The Parkland gunman “gave repeated warning signs that were ignored by federal and state officials. If we want to prevent future atrocities, we must look for solutions that keep guns out of the hands of those who are a danger to themselves or others, while protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans,” Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.

The signing marked a major victory for the teens who lived through the attack and swiftly became the public faces of a renewed gun-control movement. Just days after the shooting, they began holding rallies, lobbying lawmakers and harnessing the power of social media in support of reform.

The governor told the students: “You helped change our state. You made a difference. You should be proud.”

Scott, who said he’s an NRA member and will continue to be one, said he is still “not persuaded” about the guardian program that will let districts authorize staff members to carry handguns if they complete law enforcement training. It’s not mandatory.

“If counties don’t want to do this, they can simply say no,” he said.

The governor singled out two fathers whose children were killed, saying that they walked the halls of the Legislature since the shooting seeking change.

“I know the debate on all these issues will continue. And that’s healthy in our democracy,” he said. “This is a time for all of us to come together, roll up our sleeves and get it done.”

Student activists from the school called it “a baby step.”

“Obviously, this is what we’ve been fighting for. It’s nowhere near the long-term solution,” said Chris Grady, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High. “It’s a baby step but a huge step at the same time. Florida hasn’t passed any legislation like this in God knows how long.”

In schools, the measure creates new mental health programs and establishes an anonymous tip line for reporting threats. It also seeks to improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies.

Broward County teachers union President Anna Fusco said teachers supported the bill but not the provision allowing them to carry guns.

She said she wants Scott to veto the money for the guardian program when he receives the budget. The governor cannot veto individual items in the bill itself, but he does have line-item veto power with the budget.

The Broward County school superintendent has already said he doesn’t want to participate in the program.

Meanwhile, the 19-year-old former student accused of assaulting the school went before a judge. Nikolas Cruz faces 17 counts of murder and attempted murder. In a brief hearing Friday, he stood with his head bowed as he appeared via video conference.

Cruz’s public defender has said he will plead guilty if prosecutors take the death penalty off the table and sentence him to life in prison instead. Prosecutors have not announced a decision.","['signs', 'soon', 'block', 'shooting', 'state', 'sues', 'school', 'program', 'bill', 'public', 'gun', 'teachers', 'nra', 'veto', 'scott', 'governor']","Weeks after their children were gunned down in the worst high school shooting since Columbine, parents of the victims stood in the Florida Capitol and watched Gov.

Bangladeshi citizen found in Pakistan jail dies 4 years later,"A man who returned to Bangladesh four years ago from a Pakistani prison, where he spent 15 years on suspicion of being an Indian spy, died Thursday, his family says.",,2016-04-08T19:04:15+06:00,"A man who returned to Bangladesh four years ago from a Pakistani prison, where he spent 15 years on suspicion of being an Indian spy, died Thursday, his family said. He was 56.

Moslemuddin Sarkar had been suffering from diabetes and kidney failure, and in recent days had trouble breathing. His brother, Julhas Uddin, said Sarkar's imprisonment and torture in Pakistan had left him ""physically very weak.""

""We are preparing for his burial,"" Uddin said, sobbing. ""Please pray for my brother.""

Sarkar vanished in 1989 from his village of Bishnurampur, about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Dhaka, and traveled for several years in India before being picked up in 1997 by Pakistani authorities near the border.

He spent 15 years in prison cells in Karachi and other locations in Pakistan. His family thought he was dead. But an anonymous caller from Pakistan told them he was in Pakistan, and the International Committee of the Red Cross helped secure his return in August 2012.

He arrived at the international airport in Dhaka that year — bearded, thin and ravaged by fatigue. Family members greeted and embraced him for the first time in 23 years. Sarkar said little while wiping away tears rolling down his cheeks.

His elder brother, Sekandar Ali, gripped him tightly and said ""I can't believe you are alive! You are back!"" before more gently suggesting, ""Brother, let's go home. Mother is waiting for you.""

When Sarkar first disappeared, Ali searched the shipyard where he had once worked, but found no evidence of his brother. He and the family waited for years to hear news from Sarkar, but eventually came to believe he had died.

Upon his return to Bangladesh, Sarkar told The Associated Press that he had first crossed into India in 1989, visiting New Delhi for a few months as well as the northeastern states of Assam and Meghalaya. He then returned to New Delhi, got married and moved into a slum. But when his Indian wife left him, he decided to travel to Pakistan to find work.

""Some people told me I will get a better work if I go to Pakistan. They told me you are a Muslim, go there, you will get better chance,"" he said in 2012. ""But I got caught along the India-Pakistan border when I tried to enter Pakistan in 1997. I had no travel documents.""

Sarkar said he was interrogated and tortured by Pakistani authorities who believed he was an Indian spy.

Pakistan and India have a history of bitter relations and often imprison each other's citizens for lengthy periods for entering their territories. Both sides have freed scores of such prisoners, but hundreds are still believed held in jails.

Sarkar was to be buried Thursday night near his home, his family said. He is survived by his two brothers.","['pakistan', 'uddin', 'told', 'family', 'indian', 'dies', 'jail', 'travel', 'citizen', 'bangladeshi', 'sarkar', 'india', 'later', 'pakistani', 'brother']","His brother, Julhas Uddin, said Sarkar's imprisonment and torture in Pakistan had left him ""physically very weak.""

Further delay to make Padma bridge costlier,,,2012-07-07T00:00:00+06:00,"Delay, even by six months, in constructing the $2.9 billion Padma bridge might escalate the project's cost by 4 to 5 percent, said Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, chief of the technical evaluation committee for the project.

“The longer the delay is, the costlier the construction will be. The bridge was scheduled to be finished between 2012 and 2016. If it now finishes between 2013 and 2017 the cost will obviously escalate,” he told The Daily Star on Wednesday.

However, he said, the cost rise would be subjected to global development. “If there are huge construction works across the globe the prices of construction materials, especially of steel, would go up.

The leading engineer of the country said some local agents of foreign bidders in the Padma bridge project had triggered the corruption issue by sending dubious letters and documents to the World Bank. “There was an unholy competition among the local agents,” he added.

“I also got some anonymous emails, which I have submitted to the Anti-Corruption Commission. The companies who had failed to qualify sent numerous complains to many,” he said.

Prof Jamilur is doubtful of the bridge's construction in the near future. He, however, sees China as the silver lining. “If the government can make a successful negotiation with China there could be a chance,” he opined.

Asked how much the local agents were responsible for the WB's loan cancellation for Padma bridge, he mentioned Ventura International, local agent of disqualified China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC).

“The documents and photos submitted in the official pad of CRCC were proven false. I later came to know that the owner of CRCC's local agent company had threatened the Bridges Division officials of jeopardising the project,” said Prof Jamilur.

He said the agent had set up an office in China and used the official pad of CRCC, but the Chinese firm later disowned the agent when the forgery was exposed.

Prof Jamilur said he had heard that the local agents tried to influence members of various committees of the bridge project, but failed.

The members of the committees and the design consultant of the project AECOM-Maunsell had followed the WB guidelines and done everything accurately but the bank at some points directed and compelled them to change their decision which delayed the project, he added.

He said five firms had qualified in the pre-qualification of the main bridge construction through bidding, which had both concrete bore piling and steel recking piling options. Later on WB's suggestion, the design was changed and only the steel piling option was kept leaving the option open for the qualified firms to hire a company with steel piling experience.

“But the WB did not agree to that and pressed to float a fresh pre-qualification tender although for two months we had tried to make them understand that a fresh effort would not yield any positive result,” said Prof Jamilur, adding that the same five firms also qualified in the second pre-qualification tender.

The qualified companies are: Samsung C&T Corporation of Korea, China Major Bridge Engineering Co Ltd, Daelim-Bam-VCI (a joint venture entity of Korea), Vinci-HCC (a joint venture of France and India) and China Communication Construction Company Ltd.

At one stage, the WB started pressing for CRCC, which had been disqualified earlier.

“Although we told the bank that the firm had failed to meet the criteria of steel piling, the WB repeatedly told us to collect more information from the Chinese firm,” he said, adding that the CRCC had sent some photos of steel piling of a bridge in China which, in fact, were of Auckland Bay Bridge in California.

“As the fraudulence was exposed, the CRCC claimed that it had not submitted the photos although its local agent used the CRCC's official pads. Ventura International then wrote a letter to the Bridges Division withdrawing itself from the Padma bridge race,” said Prof Jamilur.

About the construction supervision consultancy, he said five firms -- SNC-Lavalin, Oriental, AECOM-Mounsell, Helcrow and High Point Randal -- had been selected in two-envelop-system and following the quality and cost-based process prescribed by the WB. Marking of the technical quality was 90 percent while of cost 10 percent.

At this the government formed a committee headed by the then Bridges Division secretary. When the task of the committee was almost done and it was about to submit its report, the committee was mysteriously dissolved. There were allegations that the local agents of the pre-qualified firms were making desperate efforts to influence the committee members, he said.

“A new committee headed by me was then formed and we started evaluating the tender documents of the firms. SNC-Lavalin became the number one qualified firm in our extensive technical and financial evaluation,” said Prof Jamilur.

He said the evaluation report was sent to the WB but the Canadian police raided the office of SNC-Lavalin just before the approval of the report. It eventually stalled everything.

The WB, however, had no objection about the evaluation report, he added.

On the alleged corruption in appointing the construction consultant, he said, “We know about a diary recovered by the Canadian police in which reportedly is a list of some people, including a [Bangladeshi] minister and other government officials, to whom SNC-Lavalin had pledged a certain percentage. But I think it's not the diary only as the WB would not do that [cancel the loan] based on a diary. There must be something else.”

Asked whether the WB made a harsh decision, he said Bangladesh's economic strength is very poor and hence it cannot fight with a strong institution like the WB. “But China can. WB's policy for China is more flexible than that for Bangladesh.”

Robert Zoellick, the immediate past WB president, had changed the bank's policy against corruption following China's warning that it would not borrow money from the bank, if there is any excess in the name of checking corruption, he pointed out.

He referred to a provision of the WB policy where it is said, “Our policy will not be applied uniformly to all borrowers…it depends on the country condition.”

Prof Jamilur, who is also the chairman of a 10-member international panel of experts to oversee the bridge design and that the environmental impacts were considered properly, said tender procedures of four other packages of the project were nearly completed. Of them, he said, the selection of a firm for the $160-million approach road at the Jinjira end of the Padma bridge was at the final stage.

“Unfortunately, the Islamic Development Bank, which was supposed to lend $140-million for the project, refused to approve a firm that is recommended in our evaluation report due to the loan cancellation by the WB,” concluded Prof Jamilur.","['wb', 'steel', 'prof', 'local', 'costlier', 'piling', 'china', 'project', 'delay', 'bridge', 'jamilur', 'padma', 'construction']","Delay, even by six months, in constructing the $2.9 billion Padma bridge might escalate the project's cost by 4 to 5 percent, said Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, chief of the technical evaluation committee for the project.
The leading engineer of the country said some local agents of foreign bidders in the Padma bridge project had triggered the corruption issue by sending dubious letters and documents to the World Bank.
Prof Jamilur said he had heard that the local agents tried to influence members of various committees of the bridge project, but failed.
Later on WB's suggestion, the design was changed and only the steel piling option was kept leaving the option open for the qualified firms to hire a company with steel piling experience.
Ventura International then wrote a letter to the Bridges Division withdrawing itself from the Padma bridge race,” said Prof Jamilur."

Maj Arif makes confession,"Former Rab official Major Arif Hossain yesterday admitted to his involvement in the sensational seven-murder incident in Narayanganj. In a confessional statement before a court yesterday, Arif, who was dismissed from the Bangladesh Army following the incident, also named a top Rab official, saying it was under that person's directives that the murders had been committed.",,2014-06-05T00:03:04+06:00,"Former Rab official Major Arif Hossain yesterday admitted to his involvement in the sensational seven-murder incident in Narayanganj.

In a confessional statement before a court yesterday, Arif, who was dismissed from the Bangladesh Army following the incident, also named a top Rab official, saying it was under that person's directives that the murders had been committed.

“According to Major Arif's confessional statement under Section 164, we got to know that he owned up to his role in the murder. He also admitted to the involvement of two other former Rab officials, Lt Col Tareque Sayeed and Lt Commander Masud Rana. He gave hair-raising descriptions before the court of Senior Judicial Magistrate KM Mahiuddin of how and where the seven were killed,” Fazlur Rahman, additional public prosecutor, said before a Narayanganj court during a remand prayer for Lt Col Tareque.

Following the hearing, Senior Judicial Magistrate Ishtiaq Mohammad Siddiqui granted the police a further 5-day remand to interrogate the dismissed army official.

Various sources closely linked with extracting the confessional statement from Arif told our Narayanganj correspondent that Arif admitted the entire operation was carried out on the orders of a top Rab official. The sources wished to remain anonymous on grounds of professional and personal safety.

The Rab official's name is being withheld because The Daily Star could not obtain the copy of the confessional statement to cross-check it.

Arif also gave the names of eight other Rab men, ranging from officers to constables, who were linked with the gruesome murder.

However, he said the entire plan was masterminded by Nur Hossain, according to the sources.

Narayanganj city panel mayor Nazrul Islam and his four associates and senior lawyer Chandan Sarker and his driver were abducted allegedly by some members of the Rapid Action Battalion on April 27. Their bodies were found floating in the Shitalakkhya river a couple of days later.

In his statement, Arif said Chandan had videotaped the abduction of Nazrul and his men in front of Khan Saheb Osman Ali Stadium at Fatullah on Dhaka-Narayanganj Link Road. So, they picked up Chandan and his driver as well and killed them along with the other five.

The sacked Rab officials are shown arrested in two murder cases filed by Nazrul's wife and the family of Chandan Sarker.

When The Daily Star asked the superintendent of Narayanganj police about Arif's confession, Khandaker Mahid Uddin avoided a direct reply and said, “Since Arif is confessing, the investigators have the responsibility to ensure that the evidence is credible”.

During Tareque's remand hearing, advocate Shakhawat Hossain, president of Narayanganj Lawyers' Association and counsel for the investigators, stated, “All the allegations we have made so far have been proved true through Arif's confession”.

These Rab officials were acting as hired assassins, he argued.

Despite Arif's confession, none of the progress reports submitted to the High Court by four agencies probing the incident case mentions the former Rab officials' involvement in the abductions and murders.

“I have read out the important portions of four progress reports on the investigations into the incidents before the High Court, but I have not found any mention that any Rab official is involved in the incidents,” Attorney General (AG) Mahbubey Alam said this at a press briefing at his office yesterday.

Earlier, he submitted before the HC the reports prepared by the inspector general of police (IGP), the director general (DG) of the Rab, the Criminal Investigation Department of police and the seven-member committee headed by an additional secretary of the public administration ministry.

After accepting the reports, the HC bench of Justice Md Rezaul Haque and Justice Gobinda Chandra Tagore directed the probe committees to submit reports on further progress before it on July 9.

Citing from the CID report, the AG told the HC that the CID officials have recorded statements from two witnesses in connection with the alleged involvement of the Rab officials in the incidents, and they are now scrutinizing their statements.

The CID also said in its report that 13 persons, including three former Rab officials, have been detained and are being interrogated in connection with the incident.

The Rab DG said 56 Rab and police personnel have been interrogated to find out whether they had any negligence in discharging their duties or any link with the incident.

The report of the IGP said the members of the victims' families are being given full-time police protection, and the investigation officer of the case is continuing investigation into the incident.

The seven-member committee said in its report that the committee members are recording statements from the witnesses of the incidents.

Meanwhile, State Minister for Home Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal yesterday said, “There has been progress in the investigation of the Narayanganj seven-murder incident. You will soon get to know who did it. The culprits will not be able to get away.”

Baby from ovary frozen in childhood,"A woman in Belgium is the first in the world to give birth to a baby using transplanted ovarian tissue frozen when she was still a child, doctors say.",,2015-06-10T12:05:00+06:00,"A woman in Belgium is the first in the world to give birth to a baby using transplanted ovarian tissue frozen when she was still a child, doctors say.

The 27-year-old had an ovary removed at age 13, just before she began invasive treatment for sickle cell anaemia.

Her remaining ovary failed following the treatment, meaning she would have been unlikely to conceive without the transplant.

Experts hope that this procedure could eventually help other young patients.

The woman gave birth to a healthy boy in November 2014, and details of the case were published on Wednesday in the journal Human Reproduction.

Bone marrow transplant

The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, was diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia at the age of five.

She emigrated from the Republic of Congo to Belgium where doctors decided her disease was so severe that she needed a bone marrow transplant using her brother's matching tissue.

But before they could begin the bone marrow transplant, they needed to give her chemotherapy to disable her immune system and stop it from rejecting the foreign tissue.

Chemotherapy can destroy the ovarian function, so they removed her right ovary and froze tissue fragments. At that time, she was showing signs of puberty, but had not yet started her periods. Her remaining ovary failed at 15.

Ten years later, she decided she wanted to have a baby, so doctors grafted four of her thawed ovarian fragments onto her remaining ovary and 11 fragments onto other sites in her body.

Baby boy

The patient started menstruating spontaneously five months later, and became pregnant naturally at the age of 27.

The gynaecologist who led the treatment to restore the patient's fertility, Dr Isabelle Demeestere, said it was now hoped the procedure could help other young people at risk of ovarian failure, especially given there is an increasing number of long-term survivors of haematological diseases diagnosed in childhood.

""However, the success of this procedure requires further investigation in very young pre-pubertal girls, as our patient had already started puberty even though she had not started menstruating,"" she explained.

She also warned that it would only be suitable for patients at high risk of ovarian failure, due to risks such as damaging the removed healthy ovary or reintroducing malignant cells at the time of transplant.

Professor Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, welcomed the news.

""One would anticipate that young ovaries should have lots of eggs in them, the concern was whether those eggs might develop to maturity, if the ovarian tissue was taken at such a young age and frozen and then re-implanted,"" he told the BBC.

""So, this is proof of that concept... it's very important information.""

About 40 babies have already been born across the world using frozen ovarian tissue taken from older women.","['age', 'baby', 'young', 'using', 'removed', 'ovarian', 'tissue', 'woman', 'started', 'treatment', 'childhood', 'frozen', 'ovary']","A woman in Belgium is the first in the world to give birth to a baby using transplanted ovarian tissue frozen when she was still a child, doctors say.

Google starts big advertising push around new Pixel phone,"Google's new ""Pixel"" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.",,2016-10-08T14:28:54+06:00,"Google's new ""Pixel"" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size.

""This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,"" said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency.

Alphabet Inc's(GOOGL.O) Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a ""very significant marketing campaign"".

He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous.

Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon.

Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.

But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

Murder of MP Liton: Hasina slams rights bodies for silence,Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday came down hard on the rights bodies that remained silent over the killing of Awami League MP from Gaibandha-1 Manjurul Islam Liton.,,2017-01-25T00:00:00+06:00,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday came down hard on the rights bodies that remained silent over the killing of Awami League MP from Gaibandha-1 Manjurul Islam Liton.

""These days, we often hear a hue and cry even if a small incident takes place. But when an MP was killed, neither any human rights organisation nor any person uttered a single word. Bangladesh is a strange country!"" she said.

Hasina was addressing senior officials of Bangladesh Police at the Prime Minister's Office on the occasion of Police Week 2017.

The PM said many did not raise their voice when culprits killed people of different faiths in a planned way, carried out arson attacks on mosques and set fire to the holy Quran.

Describing this as part of conspiracies, she asked the senior police officials to stay alert in this regard, reports UNB.

She also wondered why police personnel had been withdrawn from MP Liton's house and his licensed arms seized just before the killing. ""His life was put at risk in a planned way.""

The prime minister assured the officials of considering their various demands, which include raising the number of Grade-1 and 2 posts, alongside increasing the number of vehicles and infrastructural facilities.

She also suggested ensuring accommodation for all the female police trainees.

Referring to an ambassador's Facebook post after the Gulshan café attack that Bangladesh would not be able to tackle the situation, she said, “We have been able to tackle the situation within a few hours and it seemed that some were unhappy with this as they expected that we would seek their help... but they're yet to know the Bangalees fully.""

Praising again the role of police in tackling the Gulshan siege, the prime minister said they might have to face such challenges again in future.

Inspector General of Police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Haque delivered the welcome speech at the programme.

Others who spoke on the occasion include Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Home Secretary Kamaluddin Ahmed, DMP Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia, DIG of Chittagong Range Mohammad Shafiqul Islam, Additional Police Commissioner of DMP Md Monirul Islam, Additional DIG Habibur Rahman and SP of Gazipur Harun-ur-Rashid.

POLICE DEMAND

On this occasion, police demanded creating a separate division to be run by its own officials under the home ministry to speed up their operational and specialised activities.

Shafiqul Islam, DIG of Chittagong Range, placed the demand, which police have been pressing for over the last three years but never got the prime minister's nod.

Some other officials demanded steps for expansion of the counterterrorism unit's jurisdiction over the whole country, upgrading some top posts to Grade-1 and increasing training and transportation facilities.

“An additional inspector general with the rank of secretary and a DIG equivalent to joint secretary will look after the activities of the division after creation of necessary positions,” Shafiqul told The Daily Star.

Meeting sources said the prime minister asked the officials to discuss the issue of separate division formally.

Earlier in 2013, the police headquarters sent a proposal to the home ministry for separate division.

The demand was also placed during the police weeks in 2014, 2015 and last year.

The government last year split the home ministry into two divisions -- the Public Security Division and the Security Services Division. A circular was issued in this regard a week ago.

The ministry looks after the activities of Border Guard Bangladesh, Bangladesh Jail, Fire Service, Department of Narcotic Control, Ansar, Coast Guard and 10 other forces besides the police force that have around 1.94 lakh members.

According to high police officials, a separate police division would speed up recruitment, transfer and promotion in the force.

Wishing anonymity, another top official said sometimes it takes long to get approval from different ministries for important files of police.

Monirul Islam, chief of Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit of DMP, proposed expanding the unit's activities across the country. Now it needs approval from the IGP to carry out any operation outside the DMP's area.

Monirul, an additional commissioner of the DMP, also demanded higher training facilities for its officials and ensuring counter-radicalisation programmes.

DMP Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia demanded upgrading the posts of DMP commissioner, director general of Rab, chief of CID and one more additional IG post to Grade-1.

Presently, the posts of the inspector general and the chief of Special Branch are under Grade-1.","['murder', 'mp', 'officials', 'division', 'additional', 'prime', 'commissioner', 'bodies', 'rights', 'separate', 'islam', 'hasina', 'bangladesh', 'slams', 'minister', 'liton', 'silence', 'dmp']","Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday came down hard on the rights bodies that remained silent over the killing of Awami League MP from Gaibandha-1 Manjurul Islam Liton.

PM's Comments in JS : Yunus Centre responds,"On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina responded to some questions raised by the members of parliament during the PM's question hour.

Those answers were reported by different newspapers the following day. In reference to some of the prime minister's comments made during the JS session, the Yunus Centre has sent the following 'rejoinder'.



Here is what the Yunus Centre says:

Many of these accusations have been made before and Yunus Centre has responded every time. Most of these allegations were made over and over again since 2011. They have been thoroughly responded to on each occasion. All national newspapers printed these responses devoting exclusive full pages in August, 2012. We are sorry that we have to repeat our responses once again. We are again laying out the facts against every accusation made by Honorable Prime Minister.

Honorable Prime Minister: Yunus has lots of money but does not pay tax. He sues taxmen not to pay tax. He does not pay taxes on the huge amount he keeps in fixed deposits. We don't know the sources of his income. Where does all the big money come from?

Yunus Centre: The allegation of avoiding paying taxes is completely false. Professor Yunus always pays his taxes in full and without fail. He pays substantial amounts in taxes every year. Honorable Prime Minister has given false information to the nation from the floor of the Parliament. Professor Yunus never tried to avoid due taxes by making excuses. His tax files have been investigated repeatedly in order to find fault with them but every time it has come out clean. According to newspaper reports all banks in the country were asked last month to give his and his wife's financial dealings with them. Nothing new came out of these bank reports either.

There are three sources of Professor Yunus' income: 1) Speaking fees from the lectures he gives at various conferences around the world. He is one of the highly prized speakers in the global speaking circuit. This source of his income accounts for bulk of his income. 2) Royalties from his books published in over 25 languages. His books have been included in the New York Times bestsellers list, 3) Income from fixed deposits generated from items 1 and 2.

Source of each receipt under items 1 and 2 are made available to tax authorities. So the question of not knowing the source of income does not arise.

He remits his earnings from lectures and books back to Bangladesh through formal banking channels. All details are always given by the banks and are submitted to the tax authorities. To claim that sources of his income are not known to the government is not the truth. It would be very surprising to believe that relevant agency of the government did not brief the Prime Minister and inform her of the facts. If they did not do it so far even after the repeated concerns expressed from the highest level of the government about this information they should be taken to task for causing embarrassment to the Honorable Prime Minister for giving the nation false information on the floor of the parliament.

Professor Yunus keeps his money in fixed deposits in the bank. He has never invested in stocks and shares. He does not own any share in any company anywhere in the world. (It is incorrect to claim that he owns shares of Grameenphone). Not paying taxes on fixed deposits is again a meaningless allegation as tax on fixed deposit is paid at source. Since he pays taxes on all of his income that also includes income from the fixed deposits too. Tax authorities are always provided with all the details of his fixed deposits and all his other accounts.

It is correct that he contested in the court regarding some tax claims made by taxmen. This legal action was needed from Professor Yunus because of sudden departure by the tax authority from a longstanding interpretation of a tax law applied in cases of all previous tax returns of Professor Yunus. In addition this change was given retrospective effect causing an enormous tax burden. Professor Yunus went to the court to seek redress for these claims.

Honorable Prime Minister: Muhammad Yunus is a “cheat” as he did not give Grameenphone profits to Grameen Bank in “breach of the promise he made before setting up of the telecom company”. Grameenphone, she claimed, was supposed to be a joint venture between Grameen Bank and Grameenphone. Dr. Yunus sold share of Grameenphone. He had turned Grameenphone into his personal property. About 30 percent of Grameenphone shares were in his hand and the rest was sold to others.

Yunus Centre: All government records in various ministries and agencies will show that the Honorable Prime Minister is wrong on all of these counts. The creation of Grameenphone went through a long series of formalities. None of the records of the government would bear the Prime Minister out. Here are the basic facts about Grameenphone:

Grameenphone was born as a Joint Venture Company. Lead partner in this joint venture of Grameenphone is a Norwegian company, Telenor, which is owned by the Norwegian government. The second owner of Grameenphone is Grameen Telecom which is a non-profit company registered under section 28 of the Company's Act which has no private owner. Grameenphone is a publicly listed company. There are thousands of small shareholders of Grameenphone throughout the country. Because of Professor Yunus Grameenphone is the only telecom company in which 45 percent of ownership is in Bangladeshi hands including thousands of small investors. All other telecom companies are entirely foreign owned.

Grameen Telecom borrowed money from Soros Foundation to invest in Grameenphone. At no stage did Grameen Bank own any share of Grameenphone.

As mentioned before, all the documents of Grameenphone are available to the government. All information is available to the relevant government agencies. These will show that Professor Yunus never owned any share of Grameenphone at any stage of the company, nor does he own any share now. Therefore, the question of his selling shares to anyone does not arise. Similarly, since Grameen Bank did not own any share of Grameenphone at any time, the question of Grameen Bank selling shares of GP does not arise either. Grameen Telecom never sold any of its shares to anyone except in the case of selling shares to general public, as agreed by all partners of Grameenphone and the Government of Bangladesh.

Grameen Telecom operates the Village Pay Phone programme to give poor women entrepreneurs the opportunity to sell phone services in the village. Grameen Telecom is the pioneer in the whole world in bringing telephone services to the poor, to the women in particular, and to the villages for the first time in telecom history of the world. Hundreds of thousands of women made a good income from Grameen Telecom from its Village Phone Programme. Because of the significance of this programme, it has been recognized as the milestone in the history of technology. Grameen Telecom's Village Phone Programme is on display in the Glasgow Museum of Technology. As a nation we can take pride in having a place in the museum of technology. Because of the path breaking work of Grameenphone, telephone services today are so affordable. A mobile phone is now within the reach of almost all people in Bangladesh even in the remotest areas.

Profits from Grameenphone that come to Grameen Telecom, a non-profit company, are used entirely for projects that support the welfare of the common people of the country through Grameen Telecom Trust.

All documents relating to the agreement made at the time of formation of Grameenphone and also about the ownership structure of Grameenphone are publicly available and may be reviewed by anyone who is interested.

Honorable Prime Minister: Following his defeat in the legal battle, Yunus got angry and he and an editor of a famous newspaper met with the World Bank President and also lobbied with Hillary Clinton to stop funding for Padma Bridge.

Yunus Centre: It is to be noted that Professor Yunus exceeded 60 years of age during the last tenure of Awami League Government in 2001. But the government never raised the issue of Professor Yunus' age. Grameen Law does not specify any retirement age of the Managing Director.

Bangladesh Bank never raised the issue of retirement age in their reports either during the eleven years. But the issue was raised in 2011. At this point Professor Yunus submitted a writ petition to the High Court. The court refused to accept the petition for hearing on the ground that he does not have Locus Standi, which means he is not eligible to submit the petition. He appealed to the Appellate Division but his appeal was refused on the same ground. He accepted the court decision and stepped down immediately.

In the past Professor Yunus categorically rejected the claim that he influenced the World Bank through a telephone call to his friend Hillary Clinton in withdrawing the WB funds for Padma Bridge. This time Prime Minister has presented another version of the story claiming Professor Yunus along with an Editor of a newspaper met the World Bank President to lobby for withdrawal of funds for Padma Bridge. No matter which way the story is told, Professor Yunus continues to reject it. He had repeated many times, and repeats it again in this rejoinder that Padma Bridge is a dream of the people of Bangladesh and that he would dedicate all his energy to realize this dream.

Honorable Prime Minister: Professor Yunus is a usurer.

Yunus Centre: The review committee of the Government that did an in-depth review of Grameen Bank in 2011 came to the conclusion that GB has the lowest rate of interest of any microlending organization in the country. It was a report commissioned by the government which concluded that.

Furthermore, the Grameen Bank is owned by the 9 million women who borrow from it. If GB makes profit, it goes to them. Not a single penny from the bank's profits has ever gone to Professor Yunus or any other individual who is not one of the women borrower-owners of the bank. Professor Yunus was always a salaried employee of the bank, never a owner to share its profit. How that makes him a 'usurer,' is a difficult logic to fathom.

Honorable Prime Minister: 70% of the country was under water in 1998 and GB staff tortured people for installments.

Yunus Centre: The standing policy of Grameen Bank is to suspend collection of weekly installments in a situation of disaster, and turn the bank into a humanitarian organization to save life, feed people, house them, and take care of the sick. Priority for the bank is to save lives. Grameen Bank staff is known for their commitment to help the poor borrowers to overcome their problems. That's what earned the bank worldwide admiration and respect.

It is not true that GB staff would torture members for installments given the prevailing culture of the institution in disaster situation.

Honorable Prime Minister: Yunus was behind “the harassment, repression and torture” of my son, daughter, sister and my cabinet members by US intelligence agencies in the name of probing corruption allegations against them.

Yunus Centre: This is an unfounded and baseless story. Professor Yunus rejects such a fictitious story.

Honorable Prime Minister: Yunus evaded tax of some 40 to 50 Grameen companies.

The Finance Minister followed up the Prime Minister's statement with similar false allegation stating that most Grameen companies do not pay taxes, and that they claim tax exemption like Grameen Bank. Yunus has established 40/50 companies with the Grameen name, which don't pay taxes. Only GB was exempt from giving tax, not these companies.

Yunus Centre: This is a completely baseless accusation. All companies created by Professor Yunus strictly comply with the laws of land and always pay due tax. In fact, even after comprehensive attempts to find faults, no evidence of tax evasion has ever been found by the authority.

All of the organizations created by Professor Yunus regularly pay tax and VAT. None of the companies receive any tax exemption or any tax privilege. They are all audited yearly and they all submit their tax returns regularly. Just like any other business organization, these organizations also come under the oversight of respective regulatory agencies.","['centre', 'professor', 'income', 'bank', 'yunus', 'prime', 'js', 'responds', 'tax', 'grameenphone', 'telecom', 'pms', 'minister', 'comments', 'grameen']","On Wednesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina responded to some questions raised by the members of parliament during the PM's question hour.

Police oppose external probe,"The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious allegations against cops.",,2016-01-27T00:00:00+06:00,"The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious misconducts by cops.

A deputy commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police made the demand at a conference of police high-ups with the home minister and the senior home secretary yesterday, the first day of the Police Week 2016. Most police officials attending the conference applauded the demand by clapping, meeting sources said.

Defending their call, some top cops said departmental probes were sufficient to deal with any allegations against their colleagues.

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal did not make any comment in response to the police demand, but Mozammel Haque Khan, the senior home secretary, assured them that the government was “moving slow” on this, according to the sources.

The ministry formed the two committees -- one headed by a ministry representative and the other by the deputy commissioner concerned or his/her representative -- to investigate allegations submitted to the ministry against police members.

Representatives of the police headquarters were made member secretaries to both the committees.

Under the plan, the ministry committee is to probe allegations against officers with the rank of assistant superintendent of police and above while the DC or his representatives against constables, inspectors and other junior officers.

The home ministry informed the police headquarters about the decision in a letter on March 19 last year.

In June, the police HQ wrote back to the ministry, demanding repeal of the decision. Besides, top officials met the home boss several times to reiterate the call in person, police and ministry sources said.

Yesterday's call comes at a time when families are demanding judicial inquiries into the allegations of police torture on Bangladesh Bank official Golam Rabby and Dhaka South City Corporation employee Bikash Chandra Das.

These two incidents caused a huge uproar, demanding punishment to the cops involved in the alleged torture.

Many such incidents go unreported as victims believe they will not get justice given the allegations are investigated by police themselves.

The home ministry formed the two committees against such a backdrop.

At yesterday's conference, DC (Tejgaon division) Biplob Kumar Sarkar, who was the first speaker, demanded that the committees be scrapped as such committees would make police “subservient,” sources said.

According to him, the committees were formed “to shackle the force and destroy police members morally”.

He argued that there are 29 types of cadres in government service, but none of them face external probes. In their cases, senior officers investigate any allegations against their juniors.

Police officials were not happy even after the senior home secretary's assurance that the government was “moving slow”.

One police official told The Daily Star after the meeting, “If it is not scrapped altogether, it will remain like a noose around our neck.”

Contacted, Additional Home Secretary (police) Akhtar Hossain said the committees were still there. “It is not that that they will function all the time; we will use it in special cases.”

Sources in the ministry said the committees were yet to investigate a single allegation against any cop as the police reacted sharply against the formation of the committees.

Executive Director of Transparency International Bangladesh Iftekharuzzaman said police, of course, would carry out their departmental enquiry. But in case of major allegations where only departmental probe is not enough, the ministry committee can come into play.

Even, some investigations can be done by the Anti-Corruption Commission or other institutions to bring transparency and accountability and gain people's trust, he told this newspaper.

Speaking at the meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Mokhlesur Rahman said police took action in case of moral turpitude of some force members.

""But we see attempts to taint the whole force for some stray incidents of deviation,"" he said.

""If you notice, whenever we receive any allegation against anyone, we take punitive action against them,"" he was quoted as saying at the meeting.

According to the police headquarters, some 76 policemen ranging from constable to sub-inspector were sacked or sent into forced retirement over various allegations of misconduct last year.

In some other calls, officials demanded formation of a special police division, introduction of risk allowance for cops and increasing ration for the family of the police members killed while on duty.

If the special division is formed, police will be able to make quick decisions and prepare their own budget, sources said.

In response to these demands, the senior home secretary asked the police officials to place them in writing and that he would discuss those with the appropriate authorities.","['sources', 'formed', 'committees', 'senior', 'ministry', 'officials', 'special', 'investigate', 'probe', 'secretary', 'oppose', 'allegations', 'external']","The police have once again demanded that the home ministry scrap the two committees formed last year to investigate allegations of corruption, irregularities and other serious misconducts by cops.

Tahmid sent to jail after 14 days' remand,"Tahmid Hasib Khan, who had been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the Gulshan café attack, was sent to jail yesterday after his remand for 14 days in two phases ended.",,2016-08-21T00:00:00+06:00,"Tahmid Hasib Khan, who had been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the Gulshan café attack, was sent to jail yesterday after his remand for 14 days in two phases ended.

Police neither implicated him in the terror attack nor submitted a fresh remand prayer for him as they produced him in the court.

However, the law enforcement agencies told the court that Tahmid should be kept under judicial custody for the sake of investigation.

“Tahmid gave crucial information about the Gulshan attack. We are scrutinising the information. So, he should be kept in jail until the investigation is completed,” said Inspector Humayun Kabir of the counter-terrorism unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police in the forwarding report submitted to the court.

Seeking Tahmid's release on bail, a defence lawyer, however, told the court that police took him on remand in two phases “but could not unearth anything as he was not involved in the incident.”

Metropolitan Magistrate Md Delwar Hossain passed an order sending Tahmid to jail.

On August 3, Tahmid, a Canadian university student, and Hasnat Karim, a former private university teacher in Bangladesh, were detained on suspicion of their link with the July 1 terror attack.

They were shown arrested under section-54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Having both of them in custody for questioning for eight days, police on August 13, implicated Hasnat in the terror attack.

Police, however, chose to continue interrogating Tahmid under section-54 and took him on a fresh remand for six days.

Hasnat, the lone arrestee in the case linked with the murders of 20 hostages and two policemen in the attack, has been taken on another eight-day remand.

He may be produced before the court on Monday after the completion of his remand period, police said.

On July 1, five militants stormed Holey Artisan Bakery in the capital's Gulshan and held diners hostage at gunpoint.

They murdered nine Italians, seven Japanese, two Bangladeshis, one Indian and one Bangladesh-born US citizen hours before a military operation the next morning killed the terrorists and one café chef ending the siege.

Hasnat and Tahmid were among the survivors.

Tahmid went to the restaurant with two female students of a private university.

Hasnat was there with his wife and two children for celebrating the birthday of one of his daughters, family members said.

Some newspapers have recently published photographs, in which Hasnat and Tahmid are seen with one of the attackers, apparently Rohan Imtiaz, on the rooftop of the bakery.

In the photographs “collected from unknown sources”, Tahmid is seen holding a firearm.","['court', 'tahmid', 'sent', '14', 'told', 'hasnat', 'attack', 'university', 'jail', 'days', 'gulshan', 'took', 'terror', 'remand']","Tahmid Hasib Khan, who had been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the Gulshan café attack, was sent to jail yesterday after his remand for 14 days in two phases ended.

3 more women accuse Bill Cosby of assault,,,2014-11-22T00:00:00+06:00,"Bill Cosby at a news conference last week about an exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art that features a collection from him and his wife, Camille. Photo: AP

Three more women have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby, reports The Huffington Post.

Carla Ferrigno, Angela Leslie and Louisa Moritz are three of the 11 women who have now publicly identified themselves and accused Cosby of assaulting them in some form.

Ferrigno, Leslie and Moritz's claims join a growing list of allegations made against the 77-year-old actor.

In 2005, Andrea Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby claiming that he drugged and molested her in 2004. Not long after, Tamara Green went on the “Today Show” alleging she had a similar experience with Cosby. Twelve other women were anonymous witnesses in the Constand case, claiming they also had similar encounters with the comedian. One by one these women have come forward to publicly identify themselves, including Barbara Bowman, Beth Ferrier and, just days ago, Therese Serignese who spoke at length with The Huffington Post. Other women to recently make their allegations against Cosby public include publicist Joan Tarshis and supermodel Janice Dickinson.

Carla Ferrigno, actress and wife of actor Lou Ferrigno, alleges that Cosby attacked her in his home in 1967 and attempted to force himself on her before she escaped. “He walked over to me and grabbed me, pulls me really tight to him, kisses me on the mouth, like really rough. And I just took my hands and I pushed him away,” Ferrigno told KFI radio station.

Model and actress Angela Leslie says Cosby sexually assaulted her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 1992, telling the New York Daily News, “With his hand on top of mine, [Cosby] had me massage his penis.”

Louisa Moritz, a former actress best known for her role in the 1970s show “Love American Style,"" claims that Cosby sexually assaulted her, forcing her to perform oral sex on him in a green room in 1971 before going on the Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show,"" TMZ reported.

Cosby’s attorney, Marty Singer, responded to Ferrigno’s allegations in a statement to The Huffington Post. “This continuing pattern of attacks on Mr Cosby has entered the realm of the ridiculous, with a purported ‘forceful kiss’ at a party in 1967, nearly 50 years ago, being treated as a current ‘news story’ and grossly mischaracterised as a ‘sexual assault.’ This is utter nonsense.”

“People coming out of nowhere with this sort of inane yarn is what happens in a media-driven feeding frenzy,” Singer added.

The Huffington Post subsequently reached out for further comment on Moritz and Leslie's claims, but had not received a response at the time of publication.

CARLA FERRIGNO

Carla Ferrigno told KFI radio station on November 20 that she went on a date with a friend of Cosby's in 1967. She claims that he invited her to the comedian’s house after their dinner to meet up with Cosby and his wife Camille. After about 10 minutes, the two couples went to the movies, and then returned to the Cosbys’ home to play pool.

Once back at the house, Ferrigno says that both her date and Camille left the room as Cosby and Ferrigno played pool. Immediately after the pool game ended, Ferrigno claims that Cosby grabbed her.

“He was much bigger than me. Much bigger and he pulled me so hard and so rough. I had never been treated so roughly and he pulled me hard to him so hard,” she said on KFI radio station. “And then kissed me so hard, right in the mouth. No one has ever been that physically violent with me. I was stunned. I was frozen. I took all my body strength and used both of my arms to stop him and push him away from me. He was so forceful.”

ANGELA LESLIE

Angela Leslie told the New York Daily News that she was an aspiring actress when the 30-year-old met Cosby in 1992, when a driver “delivered” her to the comedian in his Las Vegas hotel suite. Once in the room, Leslie claims that Cosby told her: “If you want to act, show me what you’ve got. Pretend you’re intoxicated.” She says that he then offered her a drink, which she tasted and declined, because it was filled with alcohol. “Then he asked me to go into the bathroom and wet my hair. I walked back out, and he had removed his clothing and gotten into bed,” Leslie said.

She said the comedian pulled her into bed and put lotion in her hand. “With his hand on top of mine, he had me massage his penis,” Leslie said. “He masturbated with my hand. I wasn’t pulling back. I was in shock.” After a while she said Cosby became bored and told her to leave, telling the New York Daily News, “I didn’t drink the alcohol, and maybe since I didn’t pass out, he decided to get rid of me.”

LOUISA MORITZ

Louisa Moritz claims Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1971 in New York’s NBC Studios. Now 68, Moritz tells TMZ that she was waiting in the green room for an appearance on the Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show” when Cosby came into the room. She said he told her he was impressed with her work and ""implied that he was going to see to it that I will become a major star through his direction,” Moritz told TMZ.

“Suddenly [Cosby] approached me and took out his penis, which was now in the line of my face and pressed up against it,” she said. ""He took his hands and put them on the back of my head and forced his penis in my mouth, saying, ‘Have a taste of this. It will do you good in so many ways.’” Before walking out of the green room, Moritz recalls Cosby saying to her: ""Now you don't want to upset me and the plans for your future, do you?""

Although the statute of limitations for any sexual assault committed in 1971 would have expired, Moritz told TMZ she still plans to file a civil lawsuit against Cosby.

Cosby was set to star in his own Netflix comedy special and a new NBC show, both of which have been since been postponed or canceled.

KRISTINA RUEHLI

Kristina Ruehli, who says she was one of the anonymous Jane Does set to testify in Andrea Constand's 2005 lawsuit against Cosby, spoke to Philadelphia Magazine. The 71-year-old claims that in 1965, at age 22, she met Cosby while working as a secretary at a talent agency. She says Cosby invited her to a party, and when she showed up, it was just the two of them. ""He proceeded to pour some bourbon,"" she told Philadelphia Magazine. ""I drank a bourbon-and-7 at the time. I could really hold my liquor. I'm Irish. And I had a couple of those -- just two -- and then I just don't remember much."" She now believes that he drugged her.

According to Ruehli, her next memory was being in Cosby's bed:

It was all foggy, and I woke up in the bed. I found myself on the bed, and he had his shirt off. He had unzipped his pants. I was just coming to.

He was attempting to force me into oral sex. He had his hand on my head. He had his cock out, and he had my head pushed close enough to it -- I just remember looking at his stomach hair. And the hair on his chest. I had never seen a black man naked before.

And it never went past that. I immediately came to and was immediately very sick. I pushed myself away and ran to the bathroom and threw up.

RENITA CHANEY HILL

Renita Chaney Hill, now 47, told CBS Pittsburgh that she met Cosby in Pittsburgh when she was a 15-year-old model in the 1980s. She was cast in Cosby's “Picture Pages,” a series of educational TV segments, and was in contact with the comedian over the next four years. Hill also now believes that Cosby drugged her on more than one occasion, insisting that she drink when she was underage.

“One time, I remember just before I passed out, I remember him kissing and touching me and I remember the taste of his cigar on his breath, and I didn’t like it,” Hill told CBS Pittsburgh. “I remember another time when I woke up in my bed the next day and he was leaving, he mentioned you should probably lose a little weight. I thought that odd, how would he know that? I always thought it was odd that after I had this drink I would end up in my bed the next morning and I wouldn’t remember anything.” CBS Pittsburgh reported that Hill told them she does not remember whether Cosby forced sex on her, because she was drugged. She claims she cut off contact with Cosby when she was 19.

The Huffington Post reached out to Cosby's lawyers regarding the claims made by Hill and Ruehli, but at time of publication had not heard back.","['ferrigno', 'assault', 'claims', 'bed', 'room', 'told', 'accuse', 'cosby', 'remember', 'bill', 'women', 'leslie', 'moritz']","Photo: APThree more women have come forward with allegations against Bill Cosby, reports The Huffington Post.
