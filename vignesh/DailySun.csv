Revealed: Why men really stay single,"Men have revealed exactly why they are single and their answers may surprise you.  An anonymous Reddit user has taken to the forum to ask: Guys, why are you single? and in under 24 hours, there have already been over 17,000 contributions from men.  From laziness",,2016-11-02 00:00:00,"Men have revealed exactly why they are single and their answers may surprise you.

From laziness to being bad at picking up on signals, men confessed their reasons behind not finding - and sometimes not wanting - to find love.

One single man received plenty of support for his comment: ""Cause I am sort of selfish, and want to do what I want when I want. I can be alone without being lonely!""

They then followed up their statement with ""Unfortunately not mine"" in very small print below it.

Another man admitted the reason they are single is because they don't try.

They said that although they might just be in denial, they believe the reason they haven't met somebody is because ""I legitimately don't try. I make no efforts to not be single.""

Another said ""the whole courtship thing sounds like a real drag"" and admitted they were far too lazy and content with being single to change that.

Innalibra said he tried online dating a few times but that ""it kind of feels like you need to have absolutely zero self respect for that to work out.""

Rufio6 says: ""My mom racked up 6 divorces, my dad had 4. Just working on my career for now. If love happens, it happens.

""The likely (real) answer is that I don't put myself in positions to meet new people, and dating apps suck.""

Several men seemed to be in agreement about the fact that being single allows ""freedom.""

Handofthrawn wrote on Reddit: ""Being single is like total freedom. When I want to do something or go somewhere, I love not having to think about anyone else. I just do it.

""Am I open to finding someone compatible with my interests to do things with? Yes. But I'm not in a huge rush.""

When giving reasons as to why they're single, some admitted that they are bad at picking up signals while others said they're ""not exactly the kind of person who interests people.""

A lack of confidence and insecurity seemed to be a running theme in the thread and velvetprotein admitted it is 'Because I am fat, lazy and hate myself.

""I barely have the motivation to do things I enjoy. I've also never tried to get a girlfriend and the way I see it is if I don't try to improve myself then I'll never get one.""

Another agreed, saying: ""Being fat and shy surely isn't helping me out.""

A female interjected and replied to one post and said: ""Tip from a lady: the shyness will hinder you infinitely more than any physical flaws you may have.

""Confidence will override these flaws the majority of the time.""

The thread turned even darker when one Redditor said the reason they were single was ""because she left me two weeks ago.""

JedLeland says: ""I've just stopped trying. I'm too awkward to connect with most people on a romantic level, and the times I have connected with someone, they've almost invariably turned out to be toxic in one form or other.

""I do get lonely, but I've found that's a lot less painful than either rejection or just being with a very wrong person.""

Cremwell said the reasons for him being single was a mixture between ""not wanting to"" and ""not having met the right person"" when they did want something.

Another said that their reasons were down to mental health and that they wouldn't want to be a burden on any partner.

They added that they couldn't fathom ""what anyone would get out of a relationship with me.""","['ive', 'men', 'wanting', 'try', 'really', 'reasons', 'revealed', 'admitted', 'dont', 'reason', 'turned', 'stay', 'single']","Men have revealed exactly why they are single and their answers may surprise you.

India alcohol toll rises to 93,"GUWAHATI: Ninety-three workers have died and at least 200 others have been hospitalised in northeastern India after drinking toxic liquor, officials said Saturday, in the latest case of alcohol poisoning in the country, reports AFP. The deaths in Assam state came less than two weeks after",,2019-02-24 00:00:00,"GUWAHATI: Ninety-three workers have died and at least 200 others have been hospitalised in northeastern India after drinking toxic liquor, officials said Saturday, in the latest case of alcohol poisoning in the country, reports AFP.

The deaths in Assam state came less than two weeks after tainted liquor killed about 100 people in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

Another official from the neighbouring district of Jorhat said that 35 people had died there after consuming a batch of “spurious liquor”.

Hazarika said people started falling sick after consuming a batch of illegally produced liquor late Thursday.

The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region. The death toll could rise further as both officials said some of the afflicted were in a critical condition.

“The people came to the hospital with severe vomiting, extreme chest pain and breathlessness,” doctor Ratul Bordoloi, joint director of Golaghat’s health department, told AFP.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has ordered an inquiry.

Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told AFP that state authorities had collated “at least 80” deaths in the districts. “But apart from this some more people died outside the hospital,” he added.

“I also met the family members and relatives and ensured them that the perpetrators will not be spared,” Sarma said in a Twitter comment.

Some media reports, citing anonymous sources, said that more than 100 people had died and the exact number was still being verified by authorities.

Cheap, locally made liquor is common in parts of rural India and bootleggers often add methanol—a highly toxic form of alcohol sometimes used as an anti-freeze—to their product to increase its strength.

If ingested in large quantities, methanol can cause blindness, liver damage and death.

Hundreds of mainly poor people die each year in the South Asian country from tainted liquor, which normally costs just a few US cents a bottle.

Of the estimated five billion litres of alcohol drunk every year in India, around 40 percent is illegally produced, according to the International Spirits and Wine Association of India.

Many Indian states have implemented or pushed for prohibition, which, according to critics, further increases the unsupervised manufacture and sale of alcohol.","['states', 'liquor', 'alcohol', 'told', 'state', 'tainted', 'died', 'toll', 'toxic', 'sarma', 'rises', 'india', '93']","GUWAHATI: Ninety-three workers have died and at least 200 others have been hospitalised in northeastern India after drinking toxic liquor, officials said Saturday, in the latest case of alcohol poisoning in the country, reports AFP.

Angelina Jolie questioned by FBI,LOS ANGELES: Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitts private plane incident.  Pitt is alleged to have gotten verbally abusive and physical with,,None,"LOS ANGELES: Actress Angelina Jolie was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for four hours over her estranged husband and actor Brad Pitt's private plane incident.

After an anonymous source reported the alleged incident, the FBI got involved as they have jurisdiction because the incident occurred in mid-air.

""The agents wanted a breakdown of everything that happened from when the plane took off to when it landed. Angelina fully cooperated,"" a source told usmagazine.com.

Yet both Pitt and Jolie are eager to avoid a court case, with the source explaining: ""Neither side wants this to go to court because everything the FBI and DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) investigated will potentially be made available to the public, which would be bad for the entire family.""

It was later reported that ""Maddox suffered no injuries and some witnesses on the jet say Brad's contact with the boy was inadvertent"".

Meanwhile, it has been reported that DCFS have extended their investigation into Pitt.

The two and their children -- Maddox, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- have all been previously interviewed. The DCFS has now expanded its investigation to other alleged incidents.
